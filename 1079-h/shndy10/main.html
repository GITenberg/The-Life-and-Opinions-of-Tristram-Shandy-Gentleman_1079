done it,&mdash;the old gentleman shook his head, and in a tone more

For which cause, right glad I am, that I have begun the history of
myself in the way I have done; and that I am able to go on, tracing
every thing in it, as <i>Horace</i> says, <i>ab Ovo.</i></p>

family, but now made publick for the better clearing up this
point.</p>
<p>My father, you must know, who was originally a <i>Turkey</i>
merchant, but had left off business for some years, in order to
retire to, and die upon, his paternal estate in the county of

matter of amusement, that ever lived. As a small specimen of this
extreme exactness of his, to which he was in truth a slave, he had
made it a rule for many years of his life,&mdash;on the first
<i>Sunday-night</i> of every month throughout the whole
year,&mdash;as certain as ever the <i>Sunday-night</i>
came,&mdash;to wind up a large house-clock, which we had standing
on the back-stairs head, with his own hands:&mdash;And being

brought some other little family concernments to the same period,
in order, as he would often say to my uncle <i>Toby,</i> to get
them all out of the way at one time, and be no more plagued and
pestered with them the rest of the month.</p>
<p>It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great
measure, fell upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall
carry with me to my grave; namely, that from an unhappy association
of ideas, which have no connection in nature, it so fell out at
length, that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound
up,&mdash;&mdash;but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably
popped into her head&mdash;<i>&amp; vice
versa:</i>&mdash;&mdash;Which strange combination of ideas, the
sagacious <i>Locke,</i> who certainly understood the nature of
these things better than most men, affirms to have produced more
wry actions than all other sources of prejudice whatsoever.</p>

as it appears from the same authority, &ldquo;That he did not get
down to his wife and family till the <i>second week</i> in

practise, as his wife had given by institution,&mdash;he cheerfully

mounted, than upon a lean, sorry, jackass of a horse, value about
one pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten all description of
him, was full brother to <i>Rosinante,</i> as far as similitude
congenial could make him; for he answered his description to a
hair-breadth in every thing,&mdash;except that I do not remember
&rsquo;tis any where said, that <i>Rosinante</i> was broken-winded;

have given grounds for the contrary opinion: But it is as certain
at the same time that <i>Rosinante&rsquo;</i>s continency (as may
be demonstrated from the adventure of the <i>Yanguesian</i>
carriers) proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but
from the temperance and orderly current of his blood.&mdash;And let

parson&rsquo;s horse, I say, was just such another, for he was as
lean, and as lank, and as sorry a jade, as H<small>UMILITY</small>
herself could have bestrided.</p>
<p>In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it

green plush, garnished with a double row of silver-headed studs,
and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a housing
altogether suitable, of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of
black lace, terminating in a deep, black, silk fringe,

in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed
bridle, ornamented at all points as it should be.&mdash;&mdash;But
not caring to banter his beast, he had hung all these up behind his
study door: and, in lieu of them, had seriously befitted him with
just such a bridle and such a saddle, as the figure and value of
such a steed might well and truly deserve.</p>
<p>In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring

steadily on the one as in the other;&mdash;that brisk trotting and
slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible
movements.&mdash;But that upon his steed&mdash;he could unite and
reconcile every thing,&mdash;he could compose his sermon&mdash;he
could compose his cough,&mdash;&mdash;and, in case nature gave a
call that way, he could likewise compose himself to sleep.&mdash;In
short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but

nicety of temper, because he thought it did honour to him.</p>
<p>But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of

saddle and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or
vanity, or call it what you will,&mdash;to run into the opposite
extreme.&mdash;In the lan-</p>

have loved a good horse, and generally had one of the best in the
whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling: and
as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the
village than seven miles, and in a vile country,&mdash;it so fell
out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together
without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not
an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more
distressful than the last;&mdash;as much as he loved his beast, he
had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally
this; that his horse was either clapp&rsquo;d, or spavin&rsquo;d,
or greaz&rsquo;d;&mdash;or he was twitter-bon&rsquo;d, or
broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him,
which would let him carry no flesh;&mdash;so that he had every nine

purchase in his stead.</p>

to determine;&mdash;but let it be what it would, the honest
gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length,
by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to
take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing the whole,
and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned
to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as
to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish:
Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped
away, he could do ten times as much good;&mdash;and what still
weighed more with him than all other considerations put together,
was this, that it confined all his charity into one particular
channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the least wanted, namely,
to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish;
reserving nothing for the impotent,&mdash;nothing for the
aged,&mdash;nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly
called forth to visit, where poverty,</p>

<p class="one">and sickness and affliction dwelt together.</p>

there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out
of it;&mdash;and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law
never more to lend his steed upon any application
whatever,&mdash;or else be content to ride the last poor devil,
such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to

well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,&mdash;yet, for

<p>But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view
was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this
affair.&mdash;For you must know, that so long as this explanation
would have done the parson credit,&mdash;the devil a soul could
find it out,&mdash;I suppose his enemies would not, and that his
friends could not.&mdash;&mdash;But no sooner did he bestir himself
in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the
ordinary&rsquo;s licence to set her up,--but the whole secret came
out; every horse he had lost, and two horses more than ever he had
lost, with all the circumstances of their destruction, were known

That the family was originally of <i>Danish</i> extraction, and had
been transplanted into England as early as in the reign of
<i>Horwendillus,</i> king of <i>Denmark,</i> in whose court, it
seems, an ancestor of this Mr. <i>Yorick</i>&rsquo;s, and from whom
he was lineally descended, held a considerable post to the day of
his death. Of what nature this considerable post was, this record
saith not;&mdash;it only adds, That, for near two centuries, it had
been totally abolished, as altogether unnecessary, not only in that
court, but in every other court of the Christian world.</p>
<p>It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other
than that of the king&rsquo;s chief Jester;&mdash;and that
<i>Hamlet</i>&rsquo;s <i>Yorick,</i> in our <i>Shakespeare,</i>
many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated
facts, was certainly the very man.</p>

accompanied as governor, riding along with him at a prodigious rate
thro&rsquo; most parts of Europe, and of which original journey
performed by us two, a most delectable narrative will be given in
the progress of this work. I had just time, I say, and that was
all, to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner
in that country;&mdash;&mdash;namely, &ldquo;&nbsp;That nature was
neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius
and capacity to its inhabitants;&mdash;but, like a discreet parent,
was moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in
the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points,
pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with
few instances in that kingdom of refined parts; but a great

some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such
<i>Fracas:</i>&mdash;&mdash;For, to speak the truth, <i>Yorick</i>
had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to
gravity;&mdash;not to gravity as such;&mdash;for where gravity was
wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for
days and weeks together;&mdash;but he was an enemy to the
affectation of it, and declared open war against it, only as it
appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it
fell in his way, however sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it
much quarter.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say, that
Gravity was an errant scoundrel, and he would add,&mdash;of the
most dangerous kind too,&mdash;because a sly one; and that he
verily believed, more honest, well-meaning people were bubbled out
of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month, than by
pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In the naked temper which
a merry heart discovered, he would say there was no</p>

world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that,
with all its pretensions,&mdash;it was no better, but often worse,
than what a <i>French</i> wit had long ago defined
it,&mdash;<i>viz. A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the
defects of the mind;</i>&mdash;which definition of gravity,
<i>Yorick,</i> with great imprudence, would say, deserved to be
wrote in letters of gold.</p>
<p>But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in
the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every
other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress
restraint. <i>Yorick</i> had no impression but one, and that was
what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression
he would usually translate into plain <i>English</i> without any
periphrasis;&mdash;and too oft without much distinction of either

<p class="one">in this matter, it no way becomes me to decide. The
fact was this, That in the latter end of September 1717, which was
the year before I was born, my mother having carried my father up
to town much against the grain,&mdash;he peremptorily insisted upon
the clause;&mdash;so that I was doom&rsquo;d, by marriage-articles,

himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of all these
vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.</p>
<p>In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude
springing out of this one affair, all fretting successively in his
mind as they rose up in it, that my mother, whatever was her
journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down.&mdash;&mdash;In a

infallibly throw a balance of power, too great already, into the

our atmosphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him

nature;&mdash;&mdash;though I correct the word nature, for this
reason, that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to
a hearing, and that is, Whether this modesty of his was natural or
acquir&rsquo;d.&mdash;&mdash;Whichever way my uncle <i>Toby</i>
came by it, &rsquo;twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of
it; and that is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so
unhappy as to have very little choice in them,&mdash;but to
things;&mdash;&mdash;and this kind of modesty so possessed him, and
it arose to such a height in him, as almost to equal, if such a
thing could be, even the modesty of a woman: That female nicety,
Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which
makes you so much the awe of ours.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;My father, as I told you was a philosopher in

did the same service in establishing my father&rsquo;s system,
which, I trust, will for ever hereafter be called the <i>Shandean
System,</i> after his.</p>
<p>In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice
a sense of shame as any man whatever;&mdash;&mdash;and neither he,
nor, I dare say, <i>Copernicus,</i> would have divulged the affair

Toby now than you was before.</p>
<p>By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by

reconciled, which were thought to be at variance with each other.

nothing being of more importance to him than his recovery, and his
recovery depending, as you have read, upon the passions and
affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the nicest care to
make himself so far master of his subject, as to be able to talk

and before he was two full months gone,&mdash;he was right eloquent
upon it, and could make not only the attack of the advanced
counterscarp with great order;&mdash;but having, by that time, gone

made by an acute angle of the garden-wall,&mdash;and in the

<p class="one">A<small>T</small> the end of the last chapter, my
father and my uncle <i>Toby</i> were left both standing, like
<i>Brutus</i> and <i>Cassius,</i> at the close of the scene, making
up their accounts.</p>
<p>As my father spoke the three last words,&mdash;&mdash;he sat
down;&mdash;my uncle <i>Toby</i> exactly followed his example,
only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order
Corporal <i>Trim,</i> who was in waiting, to step home for
<i>Stevinus</i>:&mdash;my uncle <i>Toby</i>&rsquo;s house being no
farther off than the opposite side of the way.</p>
<p>Some men would have dropped the subject of
<i>Stevinus</i>;&mdash;but my uncle <i>Toby</i> had no resentment
in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my father
that he had none.</p>
<p>Your sudden appearance, Dr. <i>Slop,</i> quoth my uncle,
resuming the discourse, instantly brought <i>Stevinus</i> into my
head. (My father, you may be sure, did not offer to lay any more
wagers upon <i>Ste-</i></p>

continued my uncle <i>Toby,</i> the celebrated sailing chariot,
which belonged to Prince <i>Maurice,</i> and was of such wonderful
contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people thirty
<i>German</i> miles, in I don&rsquo;t know how few
minutes,&mdash;&mdash;was invented by <i>Stevinus,</i> that great
mathematician and engineer.</p>
<p>You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr.
<i>Slop</i> (as the fellow is lame) of going for
<i>Stevinus</i>&rsquo;s account of it, because in my return from
<i>Leyden</i> thro&rsquo; the <i>Hague,</i> I walked as far as
<i>Schevling,</i> which is two long miles, on purpose to take a
view of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nothing, replied my uncle <i>Toby,</i> to what the
learned <i>Peireskius</i> did, who walked a matter of five hundred
miles, reckoning from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Schevling,</i> and from
<i>Schevling</i> to <i>Paris</i> back again, in order to see
it,&mdash;and nothing else.</p>
<p>Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.</p>
<p>The more fool <i>Peireskius,</i> replied Dr. <i>Slop.</i> But
mark, &rsquo;twas out of no contempt of <i>Peireskius</i> at
all;&mdash;&mdash;but that</p>

<p class="one"><i>Peireskius</i>&rsquo;s indefatigable labour in
trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced the
exploit of Dr. <i>Slop,</i> in that affair, to nothing:&mdash;the
more fool <i>Peireskius,</i> said he again.&mdash;Why
so?&mdash;replied my father, taking his brother&rsquo;s part, not
only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had
given him, which sat still upon my father&rsquo;s
mind;&mdash;&mdash;but partly, that my father began really to
interest himself in the discourse.&mdash;&mdash;Why
so?&mdash;&mdash;said he. Why is <i>Peireskius,</i> or any man
else, to be abused for an appetite for that, or any other morsel of
sound knowledge: For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot
in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a very
mechanical head; and tho&rsquo; I cannot guess upon what principles
of philosophy he has atchieved it;&mdash;yet certainly his machine
has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it
could not have answered at the rate my brother mentions.</p>

elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion,
<i>Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus</i>; which, unless I have
forgot my Latin, is, <i>that it was as swift as the wind
itself.</i></p>
<p>But pray, Dr. <i>Slop,</i> quoth my father, interrupting my
uncle (tho&rsquo; not without begging pardon for it at the same
time) upon what principles was this self-same chariot set
a-going?&mdash;Upon very pretty principles to be sure, replied Dr.
<i>Slop</i>:&mdash;And I have often wondered, continued he, evading
the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains
like this of ours,&mdash;(especially they whose wives are not past
child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only
be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is
subject,&mdash;if the wind only served,&mdash;but would be
excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost
nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the
devil take &rsquo;em) both cost and eat a great deal.</p>

the objection must suppose;&mdash;no doubt then the religious and
moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed
it:&mdash;and the guilt or innocence of every man&rsquo;s life
could be known, in general, by no better measure, than the degrees
of his own approbation and censure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;I own, in one case, whenever a man&rsquo;s
conscience does accuse him (as it seldom errs on that side) that he
is guilty;&mdash;and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases,
we may safely pronounce upon it, that there is always sufficient
grounds for the accusation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;But the converse of the proposition will not hold
true;&mdash;namely, that whenever there is guilt, the conscience
must accuse; and if it does not, that a man is therefore
innocent.&mdash;&mdash;This is not fact&mdash;&mdash;So that the
common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly
administering to himself,&mdash;that he thanks God his mind does
not misgive him; and that, consequently, he has a good conscience,
because he hath a quiet one,&mdash;is fallacious;&mdash;and as
current as the inference is, and as infallible as the rule appears
at first sight, yet when you look nearer to it, and try the truth
of this rule upon plain facts,&mdash;&mdash;you see it liable to so
much error from a false application;&mdash;&mdash;the principle
upon which it goes so often perverted;&mdash;&mdash;the whole force
of it lost, and sometimes so vilely cast away, that it is painful
to produce the common examples from human life, which confirm the
account.</p>

equal,&mdash;&mdash;and that the great difference between the most
acute and the most obtuse understanding&mdash;&mdash;was from no
original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or
below another,&mdash;&mdash;but arose merely from the lucky or
unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the soul
principally took up her residence,&mdash;&mdash;he had made it the
subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place.</p>
<p>Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this
matter, he was satisfied it could not be where <i>Des

for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho&rsquo; to speak the
truth, as so many nerves did terminate all in that one
place,&mdash;&rsquo;twas no bad conjecture;&mdash;&mdash;and my
father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into
the centre of the mistake, had it not been for my uncle
<i>Toby,</i> who rescued him out of it, by a story he told him of a
<i>Walloon</i> officer at the battle of <i>Landen,</i> who had one
part of his brain shot away by a musket-ball,&mdash;and another
part of it taken out after by a <i>French</i> surgeon; and after
all, recovered, and did his duty very well without it.</p>
<p>If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but
the separation of the soul from the body;&mdash;and if it is true
that people can walk about and do their business without
brains,&mdash;then certes the soul does not inhabit there.

<p>When Dr. <i>Slop</i>&rsquo;s maid delivered the green baize bag
with her master&rsquo;s instruments in it, to <i>Obadiah,</i> she
very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through the
strings, and ride with it slung across his body: so undoing the
bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without any more ado,
she helped him on with it. However, as this, in some measure,
unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in
galloping back, at the speed <i>Obadiah</i> threatened, they
consulted to take it off again: and in the great care and caution
of their hearts, they had taken the two strings and tied them close
(pursing up the mouth of the bag first) with half a dozen hard
knots, each of which <i>Obadiah,</i> to make all safe, had twitched
and drawn together with all the strength of his body.</p>
<p>This answered all that <i>Obadiah</i> and the maid intended; but
was no remedy against some evils which neither he or she foresaw.

had</p>

been enough, had <i>Hymen</i> been taking a jaunt that way, to have
frightened him out of the country; but when <i>Obadiah</i>
accelerated his motion, and from a plain trot assayed to prick his
coach-horse into a full gallop&mdash;&mdash;by Heaven! Sir, the
jingle was incredible.</p>
<p>As <i>Obadiah</i> had a wife and three children&mdash;&mdash;the
turpitude of fornication, and the many other political ill
consequences of this jingling, never once entered his
brain,&mdash;&mdash;he had however his objection, which came home
to himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with the

was sufficient for one single man, and no more; so that, if there

whether <i>Martin</i> had doubled the cape, or had fallen upon a

<p>This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable
decency.</p>
<p>You must be informed then, that <i>Gastripheres,</i> who had
taken a turn into the kitchen a little before dinner, to see how
things went on&mdash;observing a wicker-basket of fine chesnuts
standing upon the dresser, had ordered that a hundred or two of
them might be roasted and sent in, as soon as dinner was
over&mdash;&nbsp;<i>Gastripheres</i> inforcing his orders about
them, that <i>Didius,</i> but <i>Phutatorius</i> especially, were
particularly fond of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>About two minutes before the time that my uncle <i>Toby</i>
interrupted <i>Yorick</i>&rsquo;s
harangue&mdash;<i>Gastripheres</i>&rsquo;s chesnuts were brought
in&mdash;and as <i>Phutatorius</i>&rsquo;s fondness for &rsquo;em
was uppermost in the waiter&rsquo;s head, he laid them directly
before <i>Phutatorius,</i> wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin.</p>
<p>Now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen
hands all thrust into the napkin at a time&mdash;but that some one
chesnut, of more life and rotundity than the rest, must be put in

sufficiently wide to receive the chesnut;&mdash;&mdash;and that the

spirits, all tumultuously crowded down, through different defiles
and circuits, to the place of danger, leaving all his upper
regions, as you may imagine, as empty as my purse.</p>
<p>With the best intelligence which all these messengers could

this incident, trifling as it was, wrought differently in

originally his&mdash;and in course, that it must have been the

in&mdash;&mdash;and consequently that he did it. The look of

son, and died; after whose death the son died also&mdash;&mdash;but

<p class="one">the 21st of <i>Harry</i> the Eighth, whereby it is
enacted, That in case any person die intestate the administration
of his goods shall be committed to the next of kin.</p>
<p>The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the

always implied something of a mystery&mdash;And as the court of

his riding post from <i>Calais</i> to <i>Paris,</i> and so on to

<p>&rsquo;Twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had
every foot of it to travel over again, and his calculation to begin
afresh, when he had almost got to the end of it, by

knowledge of projectils from <i>Nicholas Tartaglia</i>&mdash;My
father spun his, every thread of it, out of his own brain,&mdash;or
reeled and cross-twisted what all other spinners and spinsters had
spun before him, that &rsquo;twas pretty near the same torture to
him.</p>

<p>My father gave himself up to it, however, with the most painful
diligence, proceeding step by step in every line, with the same
kind of caution and circumspection (though I cannot say upon quite
so religious a principle) as was used by <i>John de la Casse,</i>

<p>But the reverse of this was the truth: <i>John de la Casse</i>
was a genius of fine parts and fertile fancy; and yet with all
these great advantages of nature, which should have pricked him
forwards with his <i>Galatea,</i> he lay under an impuissance at
the same time of advancing above a line and a half in the compass
of a whole summer&rsquo;s day: this disability in his Grace arose
from an opinion he was afflicted with,&mdash;which opinion was
this,&mdash;<i>viz.</i> that whenever a Christian was writing a
book (not for his private amusement, but) where his intent and
purpose was, <i>bon&acirc; fide,</i> to print and publish it to the
world, his first thoughts were always the temptations of the evil
one.&mdash;This was the state of ordinary writers: but when a
personage of venerable character and high station, either in church
or state, once turned author,&mdash;he maintained, that from the
very moment he took pen in hand&mdash;all the devils in hell broke
out of their holes to cajole him.&mdash;&rsquo;Twas Term-time with

still a stroke of one or other of &rsquo;em levell&rsquo;d at him,
and was to be fenced off.&mdash;So that the life of a writer,
whatever he might fancy to the contrary, was not so much a state of
<i>composition,</i> as a state of <i>warfare;</i> and his probation
in it, precisely that of any other man militant upon
earth,&mdash;both depending alike, not half so much upon the
degrees of his wit&mdash;as his <small>RESISTANCE</small>.</p>
<p>My father was hugely pleased with this theory of <i>John de la
Casse,</i> archbishop of <i>Benevento;</i> and (had it not cramped
him a little in his creed) I believe would have given ten of the
best acres in the <i>Shandy</i> estate, to have been the broacher
of it.&mdash;How far my father actually believed in the devil, will
be seen, when I come to speak of my father&rsquo;s religious
notions, in the progress of this work: &rsquo;tis enough to say

given more trouble than his head was worth.&mdash;But there is a
better reason still, said my father (dipping his pen into his ink);
for the ox being the most patient of animals, and the most useful
withal in tilling the ground for their nourishment,&mdash;was the
properest instrument, and emblem too, for the new joined couple,
that the creation could have associated with them.&mdash;And there
is a stronger reason, added my uncle <i>Toby,</i> than them all for
the ox.&mdash;My father had not power to take his pen out of his
ink-horn, till he had heard my uncle <i>Toby</i>&rsquo;s
reason.&mdash;For when the ground was tilled, said my uncle
<i>Toby,</i> and made worth inclosing, then they began to secure it
by walls and ditches, which was the origin of
fortification.&mdash;&mdash;True, true, dear <i>Toby,</i> cried my

the water;&mdash;nor was that enough, for those who could afford
it, as his honour could, without setting fire every night to a

those who have been entrusted with the education of our children,

perfection in the use of &rsquo;em, with his topics, that, in a few
lessons, he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with

<p>Of the number of these was my father&rsquo;s resolution of
putting me into breeches; which, though determined at
once,&mdash;in a kind of huff, and a defiance of all mankind, had,
nevertheless, been <i>pro&rsquo;d</i> and <i>conn&rsquo;d,</i> and
judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother about a month

painted, and clapped within the interior polygon to serve for
all.</p>

<p class="one">it, but with the addition of two singular
improvements, of which he was almost as proud as if he had been the
original inventor of the project itself.</p>
<p>The one was, to have the town built exactly in the style of
those of which it was most likely to be the
representative:&mdash;&mdash;with grated windows, and the gable
ends of the houses, facing the streets, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;as
those in <i>Ghent</i> and <i>Bruges,</i> and the rest of the towns
in <i>Brabant</i> and <i>Flanders.</i></p>
<p>The other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the
corporal proposed, but to have every house independent, to hook on,
or off, so as to form into the plan of whatever town they pleased.
This was put directly into hand, and many and many a look of mutual
congratulation was exchanged between my uncle <i>Toby</i> and the
corporal, as the carpenter did the work.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;It answered prodigiously the next
summer&mdash;&mdash;the town was a perfect
<i>Proteus</i>&mdash;&mdash;It was <i>Landen,</i> and
<i>Trerebach,</i> and <i>Santvliet,</i> and <i>Drusen,</i> and
<i>Hagenau,</i></p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Surely never did any <small>TOWN</small> act so
many parts, since <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah,</i> as my uncle
<i>Toby</i>&rsquo;s town did.</p>
<p>In the fourth year, my uncle <i>Toby</i> thinking a town looked
foolishly without a church, added a very fine one with a
steeple.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Trim</i> was for having bells in
it;&mdash;&mdash;my uncle <i>Toby</i> said, the metal had better be
cast into cannon.</p>
<p>This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass
field-pieces, to be planted three and three on each side of my
uncle <i>Toby</i>&rsquo;s sentry-box; and in a short time, these
led the way for a train of somewhat larger,&mdash;and so
on&mdash;(as must always be the case in hobby-horsical affairs)
from pieces of half an inch bore, till it came at last to my
father&rsquo;s jack boots.</p>

besieged, and at the close of which both <i>Ghent</i> and

contrary)&mdash;how can that be?</p>

four inches in the front, which was faced with a light blue,

to so many uses; for in all controverted points, whether military

have been a fountain in all <i>Calais,</i> which it seems there
cannot, as such an object would have been a great ornament, it is
not to be doubted, but that the inhabitants would have had it in

<p>The town-house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be

flattered my fancy with thinking of my mule, and that I should
traverse the rich plains of <i>Languedoc</i> upon his back, as
slowly as foot could fall.</p>
<p>There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller&mdash;&mdash;or
more terrible to travel-writers, than a large rich plain;
especially if it is without great rivers or bridges; and presents
nothing to the eye, but one unvaried picture of plenty: for after
they have once told you, that &rsquo;tis delicious! or delightful!
(as the case happens)&mdash;that the soil was grateful, and that
nature pours out all her abundance, &amp;c. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they
have then a large plain upon their hands, which they know not what
to do with&mdash;and which is of little or no use to them but to
carry them to some town; and that town, perhaps of little more, but
a new place to start from to the next plain&mdash;&mdash;and so

was, to take my uncle <i>Toby</i>&rsquo;s tobacco-pipe out of his

<p>The difference it made in the attack was this; That in going
upon it, as in the first case, with the end of her fore-finger
against the end of my uncle <i>Toby</i>&rsquo;s tobacco-pipe, she
might have travelled with it, along the lines, from <i>Dan</i> to

nothing more to add in this, but that in a bundle of original

had the blister, than of <i>Hilarion</i>&rsquo;s metaphor&mdash;and
our preconceptions having (you know) as great a power over the
sounds of words as the shapes of things, he had imagined, that my
father, who was not very ceremonious in his choice of words, had
enquired after the part by its proper name: so notwithstanding my
mother, doctor <i>Slop,</i> and Mr. <i>Yorick,</i> were sitting in
the parlour, he thought it rather civil to</p>

commit one of &rsquo;em&mdash;I always observe&mdash;let him chuse

astonished if it blames my uncle <i>Toby.</i></p>
<p>My A&mdash;e, quoth my uncle <i>Toby,</i> is much

expectations from his Asse in this onset; and would have brought
him on again; but doctor <i>Slop</i> setting up an intemperate
laugh&mdash;and my mother crying out L&mdash; bless us!&mdash;it
drove my father&rsquo;s Asse off the field&mdash;and the laugh then
becoming general&mdash;there was no bringing him back to the
charge, for some time&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>And so the discourse went on without him.</p>

<p>To this, I have no other answer&mdash;&mdash;at least
ready&mdash;&mdash;but that the Archbishop of <i>Benevento</i>
wrote his <i>nasty</i> Romance of the <i>Galatea,</i> as all the
world knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and purple pair of
breeches; and that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon
the book of the <i>Revelations,</i> as severe as it was
look&rsquo;d upon by one part of the world, was far from being
deem&rsquo;d so, by the other, upon the single account of that
<i>Investment.</i></p>
<p>Another objection, to all this remedy, is its want of
universality; forasmuch as the shaving part of it, upon which so
much stress is laid, by an unalterable law of nature excludes one
half of the species entirely from its use: all I can say is, that
female writers, whether of <i>England,</i> or of <i>France,</i>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;When <i>Obadiah</i> broke into the middle of the

hearing.</p>
<p>The case was this:</p>
<p>My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as
impropriator of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a Bull for
the service of the Parish, and <i>Obadiah</i> had led his cow upon
a <i>pop-visit</i> to him one day or other the preceding
summer&mdash;&mdash;I say, one day or other&mdash;because as chance
would have it, it was the day on which he was married to my
father&rsquo;s house-maid&mdash;&mdash;so one was a reckoning to
the other. Therefore when <i>Obadiah</i>&rsquo;s wife was brought
to bed&mdash;<i>Obadiah</i> thanked God&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;Now, said <i>Obadiah,</i> I shall have a calf: so
<i>Obadiah</i> went daily to visit his cow.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll calve on <i>Monday</i>&mdash;on
<i>Tuesday</i>&mdash;on <i>Wednesday</i> at the
farthest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Now the parish being very large, my father&rsquo;s Bull, to
speak the truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had,
however, got himself, somehow or other, thrust into
employment&mdash;and as he went through the business with a grave
face, my father had a high opinion of him.</p>

may have come before her time naturally enough&mdash;&mdash;Prithee

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, TRISTRAM SHANDY ***
By Laurence Sterne

* This file should be named shndy10h.htm or shndy10h.zip **

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, shndy11h.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, shndy10ha.txt

This eBook was produced by Sue Asscher with thanks to
Stephen Radcliffe for the kind loan of his books!

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
