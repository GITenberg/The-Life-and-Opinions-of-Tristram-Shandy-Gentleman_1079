<p>To the Right Honourable Mr. Pitt.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Never poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his
Dedication, than I have from this of mine; for it is written in a
bye corner of the kingdom, and in a retir'd thatch'd house, where I
live in a constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of
ill health, and other evils of life, by mirth; being firmly
persuaded that every time a man smiles,&mdash;but much more so,
when he laughs, it adds something to this Fragment of Life.</p>
<p>I humbly beg, Sir, that you will honour this book, by taking
it&mdash;(not under your Protection,&mdash;it must protect itself,
but)&mdash;into the country with you; where, if I am ever told, it
has made you smile; or can conceive it has beguiled you of one
moment's pain&mdash;I shall think myself as happy as a minister of
state;&mdash;perhaps much happier than any one (one only excepted)
that I have read or heard of.</p>
<p>I am, Great Sir, (and, what is more to your Honour) I am, Good
Sir, Your Well-wisher, and most humble Fellow-subject,</p>
<p>The Author.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.I.</h2>
<p>I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as
they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they
were about when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much
depended upon what they were then doing;&mdash;that not only the
production of a rational Being was concerned in it, but that
possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body, perhaps
his genius and the very cast of his mind;&mdash;and, for aught they
knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might
take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then
uppermost;&mdash;Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and
proceeded accordingly,&mdash;I am verily persuaded I should have
made a quite different figure in the world, from that in which the
reader is likely to see me.&mdash;Believe me, good folks, this is
not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think
it;&mdash;you have all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as
how they are transfused from father to son, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;and a great deal to that purpose:&mdash;Well, you may
take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his
nonsense, his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon
their motions and activity, and the different tracks and trains you
put them into, so that when they are once set a-going, whether
right or wrong, 'tis not a half-penny matter,&mdash;away they go
cluttering like hey-go mad; and by treading the same steps over and
over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain and as
smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the
Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.</p>
<p>Pray my Dear, quoth my mother, have you not forgot to wind up
the clock?&mdash;Good G..! cried my father, making an exclamation,
but taking care to moderate his voice at the same time,&mdash;Did
ever woman, since the creation of the world, interrupt a man with
such a silly question? Pray, what was your father
saying?&mdash;Nothing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.II.</h2>
<p>&mdash;Then, positively, there is nothing in the question that I
can see, either good or bad.&mdash;Then, let me tell you, Sir, it
was a very unseasonable question at least,&mdash;because it
scattered and dispersed the animal spirits, whose business it was
to have escorted and gone hand in hand with the Homunculus, and
conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.</p>
<p>The Homunculus, Sir, in however low and ludicrous a light he may
appear, in this age of levity, to the eye of folly or
prejudice;&mdash;to the eye of reason in scientific research, he
stands confess'd&mdash;a Being guarded and circumscribed with
rights.&mdash;The minutest philosophers, who by the bye, have the
most enlarged understandings, (their souls being inversely as their
enquiries) shew us incontestably, that the Homunculus is created by
the same hand,&mdash;engender'd in the same course of
nature,&mdash;endow'd with the same loco-motive powers and
faculties with us:&mdash;That he consists as we do, of skin, hair,
fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartilages, bones,
marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and
articulations;&mdash;is a Being of as much activity,&mdash;and in
all senses of the word, as much and as truly our fellow-creature as
my Lord Chancellor of England.&mdash;He may be benefitted,&mdash;he
may be injured,&mdash;he may obtain redress; in a word, he has all
the claims and rights of humanity, which Tully, Puffendorf, or the
best ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and
relation.</p>
<p>Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way
alone!&mdash;or that through terror of it, natural to so young a
traveller, my little Gentleman had got to his journey's end
miserably spent;&mdash;his muscular strength and virility worn down
to a thread;&mdash;his own animal spirits ruffled beyond
description,&mdash;and that in this sad disorder'd state of nerves,
he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy
dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months together.&mdash;I
tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand
weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of the physician
or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly to
rights.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.III.</h2>
<p>To my uncle Mr. Toby Shandy do I stand indebted for the
preceding anecdote, to whom my father, who was an excellent natural
philosopher, and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest
matters, had oft, and heavily complained of the injury; but once
more particularly, as my uncle Toby well remember'd, upon his
observing a most unaccountable obliquity, (as he call'd it) in my
manner of setting up my top, and justifying the principles upon
which I had done it,&mdash;the old gentleman shook his head, and in
a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than reproach,&mdash;he
said his heart all along foreboded, and he saw it verified in this,
and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me, That I
should neither think nor act like any other man's child:&mdash;But
alas! continued he, shaking his head a second time, and wiping away
a tear which was trickling down his cheeks, My Tristram's
misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the
world.</p>
<p>&mdash;My mother, who was sitting by, look'd up, but she knew no
more than her backside what my father meant,&mdash;but my uncle,
Mr. Toby Shandy, who had been often informed of the
affair,&mdash;understood him very well.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.IV.</h2>
<p>I know there are readers in the world, as well as many other
good people in it, who are no readers at all,&mdash;who find
themselves ill at ease, unless they are let into the whole secret
from first to last, of every thing which concerns you.</p>
<p>It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs, and from a
backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living, that I
have been so very particular already. As my life and opinions are
likely to make some noise in the world, and, if I conjecture right,
will take in all ranks, professions, and denominations of men
whatever,&mdash;be no less read than the Pilgrim's Progress
itself&mdash;and in the end, prove the very thing which Montaigne
dreaded his Essays should turn out, that is, a book for a
parlour-window;&mdash;I find it necessary to consult every one a
little in his turn; and therefore must beg pardon for going on a
little farther in the same way: For which cause, right glad I am,
that I have begun the history of myself in the way I have done; and
that I am able to go on, tracing every thing in it, as Horace says,
ab Ovo.</p>
<p>Horace, I know, does not recommend this fashion altogether: But
that gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a
tragedy;&mdash;(I forget which,) besides, if it was not so, I
should beg Mr. Horace's pardon;&mdash;for in writing what I have
set about, I shall confine myself neither to his rules, nor to any
man's rules that ever lived.</p>
<p>To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these
things, I can give no better advice than that they skip over the
remaining part of this chapter; for I declare before-hand, 'tis
wrote only for the curious and inquisitive.</p>
<p>&mdash;Shut the door.&mdash;</p>
<p>I was begot in the night betwixt the first Sunday and the first
Monday in the month of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and eighteen. I am positive I was.&mdash;But how I
came to be so very particular in my account of a thing which
happened before I was born, is owing to another small anecdote
known only in our own family, but now made publick for the better
clearing up this point.</p>
<p>My father, you must know, who was originally a Turkey merchant,
but had left off business for some years, in order to retire to,
and die upon, his paternal estate in the county of &mdash;&mdash;,
was, I believe, one of the most regular men in every thing he did,
whether 'twas matter of business, or matter of amusement, that ever
lived. As a small specimen of this extreme exactness of his, to
which he was in truth a slave, he had made it a rule for many years
of his life,&mdash;on the first Sunday-night of every month
throughout the whole year,&mdash;as certain as ever the
Sunday-night came,&mdash;to wind up a large house-clock, which we
had standing on the back-stairs head, with his own hands:&mdash;And
being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time I
have been speaking of,&mdash;he had likewise gradually brought some
other little family concernments to the same period, in order, as
he would often say to my uncle Toby, to get them all out of the way
at one time, and be no more plagued and pestered with them the rest
of the month.</p>
<p>It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great
measure, fell upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall
carry with me to my grave; namely, that from an unhappy association
of ideas, which have no connection in nature, it so fell out at
length, that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound
up,&mdash;but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably popped
into her head&mdash;&amp; vice versa:&mdash;Which strange
combination of ideas, the sagacious Locke, who certainly understood
the nature of these things better than most men, affirms to have
produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice
whatsoever.</p>
<p>But this by the bye.</p>
<p>Now it appears by a memorandum in my father's pocket-book, which
now lies upon the table, 'That on Lady-day, which was on the 25th
of the same month in which I date my geniture,&mdash;my father set
upon his journey to London, with my eldest brother Bobby, to fix
him at Westminster school;' and, as it appears from the same
authority, 'That he did not get down to his wife and family till
the second week in May following,'&mdash;it brings the thing almost
to a certainty. However, what follows in the beginning of the next
chapter, puts it beyond all possibility of a doubt.</p>
<p>&mdash;But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all December,
January, and February?&mdash;Why, Madam,&mdash;he was all that time
afflicted with a Sciatica.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.V.</h2>
<p>On the fifth day of November, 1718, which to the aera fixed on,
was as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason
have expected,&mdash;was I Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, brought
forth into this scurvy and disastrous world of ours.&mdash;I wish I
had been born in the Moon, or in any of the planets, (except
Jupiter or Saturn, because I never could bear cold weather) for it
could not well have fared worse with me in any of them (though I
will not answer for Venus) than it has in this vile, dirty planet
of ours,&mdash;which, o' my conscience, with reverence be it
spoken, I take to be made up of the shreds and clippings of the
rest;&mdash;not but the planet is well enough, provided a man could
be born in it to a great title or to a great estate; or could any
how contrive to be called up to public charges, and employments of
dignity or power;&mdash;but that is not my case;&mdash;and
therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has
gone in it;&mdash;for which cause I affirm it over again to be one
of the vilest worlds that ever was made;&mdash;for I can truly say,
that from the first hour I drew my breath in it, to this, that I
can now scarce draw it at all, for an asthma I got in scating
against the wind in Flanders;&mdash;I have been the continual sport
of what the world calls Fortune; and though I will not wrong her by
saying, She has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal
evil;&mdash;yet with all the good temper in the world I affirm it
of her, that in every stage of my life, and at every turn and
corner where she could get fairly at me, the ungracious duchess has
pelted me with a set of as pitiful misadventures and cross
accidents as ever small Hero sustained.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.VI.</h2>
<p>In the beginning of the last chapter, I informed you exactly
when I was born; but I did not inform you how. No, that particular
was reserved entirely for a chapter by itself;&mdash;besides, Sir,
as you and I are in a manner perfect strangers to each other, it
would not have been proper to have let you into too many
circumstances relating to myself all at once.</p>
<p>&mdash;You must have a little patience. I have undertaken, you
see, to write not only my life, but my opinions also; hoping and
expecting that your knowledge of my character, and of what kind of
a mortal I am, by the one, would give you a better relish for the
other: As you proceed farther with me, the slight acquaintance,
which is now beginning betwixt us, will grow into familiarity; and
that unless one of us is in fault, will terminate in
friendship.&mdash;O diem praeclarum!&mdash;then nothing which has
touched me will be thought trifling in its nature, or tedious in
its telling. Therefore, my dear friend and companion, if you should
think me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first setting
out&mdash;bear with me,&mdash;and let me go on, and tell my story
my own way:&mdash;Or, if I should seem now and then to trifle upon
the road,&mdash;or should sometimes put on a fool's cap with a bell
to it, for a moment or two as we pass along,&mdash;don't fly
off,&mdash;but rather courteously give me credit for a little more
wisdom than appears upon my outside;&mdash;and as we jog on, either
laugh with me, or at me, or in short do any thing,&mdash;only keep
your temper.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.VII.</h2>
<p>In the same village where my father and my mother dwelt, dwelt
also a thin, upright, motherly, notable, good old body of a
midwife, who with the help of a little plain good sense, and some
years full employment in her business, in which she had all along
trusted little to her own efforts, and a great deal to those of
dame Nature,&mdash;had acquired, in her way, no small degree of
reputation in the world:&mdash;by which word world, need I in this
place inform your worship, that I would be understood to mean no
more of it, than a small circle described upon the circle of the
great world, of four English miles diameter, or thereabouts, of
which the cottage where the good old woman lived is supposed to be
the centre?&mdash;She had been left it seems a widow in great
distress, with three or four small children, in her forty-seventh
year; and as she was at that time a person of decent
carriage,&mdash;grave deportment,&mdash;a woman moreover of few
words and withal an object of compassion, whose distress, and
silence under it, called out the louder for a friendly lift: the
wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity; and having
often lamented an inconvenience to which her husband's flock had
for many years been exposed, inasmuch as there was no such thing as
a midwife, of any kind or degree, to be got at, let the case have
been never so urgent, within less than six or seven long miles
riding; which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal
roads, the country thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay, was
almost equal to fourteen; and that in effect was sometimes next to
having no midwife at all; it came into her head, that it would be
doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole parish, as to the poor
creature herself, to get her a little instructed in some of the
plain principles of the business, in order to set her up in it. As
no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she
had formed than herself, the gentlewoman very charitably undertook
it; and having great influence over the female part of the parish,
she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her
wishes. In truth, the parson join'd his interest with his wife's in
the whole affair, and in order to do things as they should be, and
give the poor soul as good a title by law to practise, as his wife
had given by institution,&mdash;he cheerfully paid the fees for the
ordinary's licence himself, amounting in the whole, to the sum of
eighteen shillings and four pence; so that betwixt them both, the
good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal possession
of her office, together with all its rights, members, and
appurtenances whatsoever.</p>
<p>These last words, you must know, were not according to the old
form in which such licences, faculties, and powers usually ran,
which in like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood.
But it was according to a neat Formula of Didius his own devising,
who having a particular turn for taking to pieces, and new framing
over again all kind of instruments in that way, not only hit upon
this dainty amendment, but coaxed many of the old licensed matrons
in the neighbourhood, to open their faculties afresh, in order to

<p>I own I never could envy Didius in these kinds of fancies of

Kunastrokius, that great man, at his leisure hours, take the
greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses tails, and plucking
the dead hairs out with his teeth, though he had tweezers always in
his pocket? Nay, if you come to that, Sir, have not the wisest of
men in all ages, not excepting Solomon himself,&mdash;have they not
had their Hobby-Horses;&mdash;their running horses,&mdash;their
coins and their cockle-shells, their drums and their trumpets,
their fiddles, their pallets,&mdash;their maggots and their
butterflies?&mdash;and so long as a man rides his Hobby-Horse
peaceably and quietly along the King's highway, and neither compels
you or me to get up behind him,&mdash;pray, Sir, what have either
you or I to do with it?</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.VIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;De gustibus non est disputandum;&mdash;that is, there is
no disputing against Hobby-Horses; and for my part, I seldom do;
nor could I with any sort of grace, had I been an enemy to them at
the bottom; for happening, at certain intervals and changes of the
moon, to be both fidler and painter, according as the fly
stings:&mdash;Be it known to you, that I keep a couple of pads
myself, upon which, in their turns, (nor do I care who knows it) I
frequently ride out and take the air;&mdash;though sometimes, to my
shame be it spoken, I take somewhat longer journies than what a
wise man would think altogether right.&mdash;But the truth
is,&mdash;I am not a wise man;&mdash;and besides am a mortal of so
little consequence in the world, it is not much matter what I do:
so I seldom fret or fume at all about it: Nor does it much disturb
my rest, when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as
hereafter follow;&mdash;such, for instance, as my Lord A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and so on, all of a row,
mounted upon their several horses,&mdash;some with large stirrups,
getting on in a more grave and sober pace;&mdash;others on the
contrary, tucked up to their very chins, with whips across their
mouths, scouring and scampering it away like so many little
party-coloured devils astride a mortgage,&mdash;and as if some of
them were resolved to break their necks.&mdash;So much the
better&mdash;say I to myself;&mdash;for in case the worst should
happen, the world will make a shift to do excellently well without
them; and for the rest,&mdash;why&mdash;God speed them&mdash;e'en
let them ride on without opposition from me; for were their
lordships unhorsed this very night&mdash;'tis ten to one but that
many of them would be worse mounted by one half before tomorrow
morning.</p>
<p>Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in
upon my rest.&mdash;But there is an instance, which I own puts me
off my guard, and that is, when I see one born for great actions,
and what is still more for his honour, whose nature ever inclines
him to good ones;&mdash;when I behold such a one, my Lord, like
yourself, whose principles and conduct are as generous and noble as
his blood, and whom, for that reason, a corrupt world cannot spare
one moment;&mdash;when I see such a one, my Lord, mounted, though
it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country
has prescribed to him, and my zeal for his glory
wishes,&mdash;then, my Lord, I cease to be a philosopher, and in
the first transport of an honest impatience, I wish the
Hobby-Horse, with all his fraternity, at the Devil.</p>
<p>'My Lord, I maintain this to be a dedication, notwithstanding
its singularity in the three great essentials of matter, form and
place: I beg, therefore, you will accept it as such, and that you
will permit me to lay it, with the most respectful humility, at
your Lordship's feet&mdash;when you are upon them,&mdash;which you
can be when you please;&mdash;and that is, my Lord, whenever there
is occasion for it, and I will add, to the best purposes too. I
have the honour to be,</p>
<pre>
                        My Lord,
                        Your Lordship's most obedient,
                        and most devoted,
                        and most humble servant,
                        Tristram Shandy.'

<h2>Chapter 1.IX.</h2>
<p>I solemnly declare to all mankind, that the above dedication was
made for no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or Potentate,&mdash;Duke,
Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, of this, or any other Realm in
Christendom;&mdash;nor has it yet been hawked about, or offered
publicly or privately, directly or indirectly, to any one person or
personage, great or small; but is honestly a true Virgin-Dedication
untried on, upon any soul living.</p>
<p>I labour this point so particularly, merely to remove any
offence or objection which might arise against it from the manner
in which I propose to make the most of it;&mdash;which is the
putting it up fairly to public sale; which I now do.</p>
<p>&mdash;Every author has a way of his own in bringing his points
to bear;&mdash;for my own part, as I hate chaffering and higgling
for a few guineas in a dark entry;&mdash;I resolved within myself,
from the very beginning, to deal squarely and openly with your
Great Folks in this affair, and try whether I should not come off
the better by it.</p>
<p>If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or
Baron, in these his Majesty's dominions, who stands in need of a
tight, genteel dedication, and whom the above will suit, (for by
the bye, unless it suits in some degree, I will not part with
it)&mdash;it is much at his service for fifty guineas;&mdash;which
I am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to be afforded
for, by any man of genius.</p>
<p>My Lord, if you examine it over again, it is far from being a
gross piece of daubing, as some dedications are. The design, your
Lordship sees, is good,&mdash;the colouring transparent,&mdash;the
drawing not amiss;&mdash;or to speak more like a man of
science,&mdash;and measure my piece in the painter's scale, divided
into 20,&mdash;I believe, my Lord, the outlines will turn out as
12,&mdash;the composition as 9,&mdash;the colouring as 6,&mdash;the
expression 13 and a half,&mdash;and the design,&mdash;if I may be
allowed, my Lord, to understand my own design, and supposing
absolute perfection in designing, to be as 20,&mdash;I think it
cannot well fall short of 19. Besides all this,&mdash;there is
keeping in it, and the dark strokes in the Hobby-Horse, (which is a
secondary figure, and a kind of back-ground to the whole) give
great force to the principal lights in your own figure, and make it
come off wonderfully;&mdash;and besides, there is an air of
originality in the tout ensemble.</p>
<p>Be pleased, my good Lord, to order the sum to be paid into the
hands of Mr. Dodsley, for the benefit of the author; and in the
next edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged, and
your Lordship's titles, distinctions, arms, and good actions, be
placed at the front of the preceding chapter: All which, from the
words, De gustibus non est disputandum, and whatever else in this
book relates to Hobby-Horses, but no more, shall stand dedicated to
your Lordship.&mdash;The rest I dedicate to the Moon, who, by the
bye, of all the Patrons or Matrons I can think of, has most power
to set my book a-going, and make the world run mad after it.</p>
<p>Bright Goddess, If thou art not too busy with Candid and Miss
Cunegund's affairs,&mdash;take Tristram Shandy's under thy
protection also.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.X.</h2>
<p>Whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of
the midwife might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly
rested,&mdash;at first sight seems not very material to this
history;&mdash;certain however it was, that the gentlewoman, the
parson's wife, did run away at that time with the whole of it: And
yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking but that the parson
himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design
first,&mdash;yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was
laid before him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it
into execution, had a claim to some share of it,&mdash;if not to a
full half of whatever honour was due to it.</p>
<p>The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter
otherwise.</p>
<p>Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a
probable guess at the grounds of this procedure.</p>
<p>Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of
the midwife's licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an
account,&mdash;the parson we have to do with had made himself a
country-talk by a breach of all decorum, which he had committed
against himself, his station, and his office;&mdash;and that was in
never appearing better, or otherwise mounted, than upon a lean,
sorry, jackass of a horse, value about one pound fifteen shillings;
who, to shorten all description of him, was full brother to
Rosinante, as far as similitude congenial could make him; for he
answered his description to a hair-breadth in every
thing,&mdash;except that I do not remember 'tis any where said,
that Rosinante was broken-winded; and that, moreover, Rosinante, as
is the happiness of most Spanish horses, fat or lean,&mdash;was
undoubtedly a horse at all points.</p>
<p>I know very well that the Hero's horse was a horse of chaste
deportment, which may have given grounds for the contrary opinion:
But it is as certain at the same time that Rosinante's continency
(as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesian
carriers) proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but
from the temperance and orderly current of his blood.&mdash;And let
me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of very good chastity in
the world, in behalf of which you could not say more for your
life.</p>
<p>Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do exact justice to
every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic
work,&mdash;I could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don
Quixote's horse;&mdash;in all other points, the parson's horse, I
say, was just such another, for he was as lean, and as lank, and as
sorry a jade, as Humility herself could have bestrided.</p>
<p>In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it
was greatly in the parson's power to have helped the figure of this
horse of his,&mdash;for he was master of a very handsome
demi-peaked saddle, quilted on the seat with green plush, garnished
with a double row of silver-headed studs, and a noble pair of
shining brass stirrups, with a housing altogether suitable, of grey
superfine cloth, with an edging of black lace, terminating in a
deep, black, silk fringe, poudre d'or,&mdash;all which he had
purchased in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand
embossed bridle, ornamented at all points as it should
be.&mdash;But not caring to banter his beast, he had hung all these
up behind his study door: and, in lieu of them, had seriously
befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle, as the
figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve.</p>
<p>In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring
visits to the gentry who lived around him,&mdash;you will easily
comprehend, that the parson, so appointed, would both hear and see
enough to keep his philosophy from rusting. To speak the truth, he
never could enter a village, but he caught the attention of both
old and young.&mdash;Labour stood still as he pass'd&mdash;the
bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well,&mdash;the
spinning-wheel forgot its round,&mdash;even chuck-farthing and
shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight;
and as his movement was not of the quickest, he had generally time
enough upon his hands to make his observations,&mdash;to hear the
groans of the serious,&mdash;and the laughter of the light-hearted;
all which he bore with excellent tranquillity.&mdash;His character
was,&mdash;he loved a jest in his heart&mdash;and as he saw himself
in the true point of ridicule, he would say he could not be angry
with others for seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw
himself: So that to his friends, who knew his foible was not the
love of money, and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering
the extravagance of his humour,&mdash;instead of giving the true
cause,&mdash;he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself;
and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own
bones, being altogether as spare a figure as his beast,&mdash;he
would sometimes insist upon it, that the horse was as good as the
rider deserved;&mdash;that they were, centaur-like,&mdash;both of a
piece. At other times, and in other moods, when his spirits were
above the temptation of false wit,&mdash;he would say, he found
himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great gravity,
would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse, without
a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and
that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to
keep himself in countenance, but in spirits.</p>
<p>At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite
reasons for riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse,
preferably to one of mettle;&mdash;for on such a one he could sit
mechanically, and meditate as delightfully de vanitate mundi et
fuga faeculi, as with the advantage of a death's-head before
him;&mdash;that, in all other exercitations, he could spend his
time, as he rode slowly along,&mdash;to as much account as in his
study;&mdash;that he could draw up an argument in his
sermon,&mdash;or a hole in his breeches, as steadily on the one as
in the other;&mdash;that brisk trotting and slow argumentation,
like wit and judgment, were two incompatible movements.&mdash;But
that upon his steed&mdash;he could unite and reconcile every
thing,&mdash;he could compose his sermon&mdash;he could compose his
cough,&mdash;and, in case nature gave a call that way, he could
likewise compose himself to sleep.&mdash;In short, the parson upon
such encounters would assign any cause but the true
cause,&mdash;and he withheld the true one, only out of a nicety of
temper, because he thought it did honour to him.</p>
<p>But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of
this gentleman's life, and about the time when the superb saddle
and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or
vanity, or call it what you will,&mdash;to run into the opposite
extreme.&mdash;In the language of the county where he dwelt, he was
said to have loved a good horse, and generally had one of the best
in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for
saddling: and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live
nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile
country,&mdash;it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a
whole week together without some piteous application for his beast;
and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more
pressing and more distressful than the last;&mdash;as much as he
loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of
which was generally this; that his horse was either clapp'd, or
spavin'd, or greaz'd;&mdash;or he was twitter-bon'd, or
broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him,
which would let him carry no flesh;&mdash;so that he had every nine
or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,&mdash;and a good horse to
purchase in his stead.</p>
<p>What the loss in such a balance might amount to, communibus
annis, I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same
traffick, to determine;&mdash;but let it be what it would, the
honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at
length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it
necessary to take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing
the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only
disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an
article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of
generosity in his parish: Besides this, he considered that with
half the sum thus galloped away, he could do ten times as much
good;&mdash;and what still weighed more with him than all other
considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his
charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it
was the least wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and
child-getting part of his parish; reserving nothing for the
impotent,&mdash;nothing for the aged,&mdash;nothing for the many
comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where
poverty, and sickness and affliction dwelt together.</p>
<p>For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and
there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out
of it;&mdash;and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law
never more to lend his steed upon any application
whatever,&mdash;or else be content to ride the last poor devil,
such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities, to
the very end of the chapter.</p>
<p>As he dreaded his own constancy in the first&mdash;he very
chearfully betook himself to the second; and though he could very
well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,&mdash;yet, for
that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear
the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than
undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a panegyrick
upon himself.</p>
<p>I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments
of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his
character, which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements
of the peerless knight of La Mancha, whom, by the bye, with all his
follies, I love more, and would actually have gone farther to have
paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of antiquity.</p>
<p>But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view
was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this
affair.&mdash;For you must know, that so long as this explanation
would have done the parson credit,&mdash;the devil a soul could
find it out,&mdash;I suppose his enemies would not, and that his
friends could not.&mdash;But no sooner did he bestir himself in
behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary's
licence to set her up,&mdash;but the whole secret came out; every
horse he had lost, and two horses more than ever he had lost, with
all the circumstances of their destruction, were known and
distinctly remembered.&mdash;The story ran like
wild-fire.&mdash;'The parson had a returning fit of pride which had
just seized him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in
his life; and if it was so, 'twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he
would pocket the expence of the licence ten times told, the very
first year:&mdash;So that every body was left to judge what were
his views in this act of charity.'</p>
<p>What were his views in this, and in every other action of his
life,&mdash;or rather what were the opinions which floated in the
brains of other people concerning it, was a thought which too much
floated in his own, and too often broke in upon his rest, when he
should have been sound asleep.</p>
<p>About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be
made entirely easy upon that score,&mdash;it being just so long
since he left his parish,&mdash;and the whole world at the same
time behind him,&mdash;and stands accountable to a Judge of whom he
will have no cause to complain.</p>
<p>But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order
them as they will, they pass thro' a certain medium, which so
twists and refracts them from their true directions&mdash;that,
with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give,
the doers of them are nevertheless forced to live and die without
it.</p>
<p>Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful
example.&mdash;But to know by what means this came to
pass,&mdash;and to make that knowledge of use to you, I insist upon
it that you read the two following chapters, which contain such a
sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along
with it.&mdash;When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way,
we will go on with the midwife.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XI.</h2>
<p>Yorick was this parson's name, and, what is very remarkable in
it, (as appears from a most ancient account of the family, wrote
upon strong vellum, and now in perfect preservation) it had been
exactly so spelt for near,&mdash;I was within an ace of saying nine
hundred years;&mdash;but I would not shake my credit in telling an
improbable truth, however indisputable in itself,&mdash;and
therefore I shall content myself with only saying&mdash;It had been
exactly so spelt, without the least variation or transposition of a
single letter, for I do not know how long; which is more than I
would venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the
kingdom; which, in a course of years, have generally undergone as
many chops and changes as their owners.&mdash;Has this been owing
to the pride, or to the shame of the respective
proprietors?&mdash;In honest truth, I think sometimes to the one,
and sometimes to the other, just as the temptation has wrought. But
a villainous affair it is, and will one day so blend and confound
us all together, that no one shall be able to stand up and swear,
'That his own great grandfather was the man who did either this or
that.'</p>
<p>This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent
care of the Yorick's family, and their religious preservation of
these records I quote, which do farther inform us, That the family
was originally of Danish extraction, and had been transplanted into
England as early as in the reign of Horwendillus, king of Denmark,
in whose court, it seems, an ancestor of this Mr. Yorick's, and
from whom he was lineally descended, held a considerable post to
the day of his death. Of what nature this considerable post was,
this record saith not;&mdash;it only adds, That, for near two
centuries, it had been totally abolished, as altogether
unnecessary, not only in that court, but in every other court of
the Christian world.</p>
<p>It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other
than that of the king's chief Jester;&mdash;and that Hamlet's
Yorick, in our Shakespeare, many of whose plays, you know, are
founded upon authenticated facts, was certainly the very man.</p>
<p>I have not the time to look into Saxo-Grammaticus's Danish
history, to know the certainty of this;&mdash;but if you have
leisure, and can easily get at the book, you may do it full as well
yourself.</p>
<p>I had just time, in my travels through Denmark with Mr. Noddy's
eldest son, whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied as governor,
riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro' most parts of
Europe, and of which original journey performed by us two, a most
delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work. I
had just time, I say, and that was all, to prove the truth of an
observation made by a long sojourner in that country;&mdash;namely,
'That nature was neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in
her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants;&mdash;but,
like a discreet parent, was moderately kind to them all; observing
such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours, as to bring
them, in those points, pretty near to a level with each other; so
that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refined
parts; but a great deal of good plain houshold understanding
amongst all ranks of people, of which every body has a share;'
which is, I think, very right.</p>
<p>With us, you see, the case is quite different:&mdash;we are all
ups and downs in this matter;&mdash;you are a great
genius;&mdash;or 'tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great dunce and
a blockhead;&mdash;not that there is a total want of intermediate
steps,&mdash;no,&mdash;we are not so irregular as that comes
to;&mdash;but the two extremes are more common, and in a greater
degree in this unsettled island, where nature, in her gifts and
dispositions of this kind, is most whimsical and capricious;
fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and
chattels than she.</p>
<p>This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to Yorick's
extraction, who, by what I can remember of him, and by all the
accounts I could ever get of him, seemed not to have had one single
drop of Danish blood in his whole crasis; in nine hundred years, it
might possibly have all run out:&mdash;I will not philosophize one
moment with you about it; for happen how it would, the fact was
this:&mdash;That instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity
of sense and humours, you would have looked for, in one so
extracted;&mdash;he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and
sublimated a composition,&mdash;as heteroclite a creature in all
his declensions;&mdash;with as much life and whim, and gaite de
coeur about him, as the kindliest climate could have engendered and
put together. With all this sail, poor Yorick carried not one ounce
of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world; and at the age
of twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his course in
it, as a romping, unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that upon his
first setting out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will
imagine, ran him foul ten times in a day of somebody's tackling;
and as the grave and more slow-paced were oftenest in his
way,&mdash;you may likewise imagine, 'twas with such he had
generally the ill luck to get the most entangled. For aught I know
there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such
Fracas:&mdash;For, to speak the truth, Yorick had an invincible
dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity;&mdash;not to
gravity as such;&mdash;for where gravity was wanted, he would be
the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks
together;&mdash;but he was an enemy to the affectation of it, and
declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for
ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it fell in his way,
however sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much
quarter.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say, that
Gravity was an errant scoundrel, and he would add,&mdash;of the
most dangerous kind too,&mdash;because a sly one; and that he
verily believed, more honest, well-meaning people were bubbled out
of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month, than by
pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In the naked temper which
a merry heart discovered, he would say there was no
danger,&mdash;but to itself:&mdash;whereas the very essence of
gravity was design, and consequently deceit;&mdash;'twas a taught
trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than
a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,&mdash;it was
no better, but often worse, than what a French wit had long ago
defined it,&mdash;viz. 'A mysterious carriage of the body to cover
the defects of the mind;'&mdash;which definition of gravity,
Yorick, with great imprudence, would say, deserved to be wrote in
letters of gold.</p>
<p>But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in
the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every
other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress
restraint. Yorick had no impression but one, and that was what
arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression he
would usually translate into plain English without any
periphrasis;&mdash;and too oft without much distinction of either
person, time, or place;&mdash;so that when mention was made of a
pitiful or an ungenerous proceeding&mdash;he never gave himself a
moment's time to reflect who was the hero of the piece,&mdash;what
his station,&mdash;or how far he had power to hurt him
hereafter;&mdash;but if it was a dirty action,&mdash;without more
ado,&mdash;The man was a dirty fellow,&mdash;and so on.&mdash;And
as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in
a bon mot, or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or
humour of expression, it gave wings to Yorick's indiscretion. In a
word, tho' he never sought, yet, at the same time, as he seldom
shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without much
ceremony;&mdash;he had but too many temptations in life, of
scattering his wit and his humour,&mdash;his gibes and his jests
about him.&mdash;They were not lost for want of gathering.</p>
<p>What were the consequences, and what was Yorick's catastrophe
thereupon, you will read in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XII.</h2>
<p>The Mortgager and Mortgagee differ the one from the other, not
more in length of purse, than the Jester and Jestee do, in that of
memory. But in this the comparison between them runs, as the
scholiasts call it, upon all-four; which, by the bye, is upon one
or two legs more than some of the best of Homer's can pretend
to;&mdash;namely, That the one raises a sum, and the other a laugh
at your expence, and thinks no more about it. Interest, however,
still runs on in both cases;&mdash;the periodical or accidental
payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair
alive; till, at length, in some evil hour, pop comes the creditor
upon each, and by demanding principal upon the spot, together with
full interest to the very day, makes them both feel the full extent
of their obligations.</p>
<p>As the reader (for I hate your ifs) has a thorough knowledge of
human nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my Hero
could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of
these incidental mementos. To speak the truth, he had wantonly
involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts of this stamp,
which, notwithstanding Eugenius's frequent advice, he too much
disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted thro'
any malignancy;&mdash;but, on the contrary, from an honesty of
mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be
cross'd out in course.</p>
<p>Eugenius would never admit this; and would often tell him, that
one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would
often add, in an accent of sorrowful apprehension,&mdash;to the
uttermost mite. To which Yorick, with his usual carelessness of
heart, would as often answer with a pshaw!&mdash;and if the subject
was started in the fields,&mdash;with a hop, skip, and a jump at
the end of it; but if close pent up in the social chimney-corner,
where the culprit was barricado'd in, with a table and a couple of
arm-chairs, and could not so readily fly off in a
tangent,&mdash;Eugenius would then go on with his lecture upon
discretion in words to this purpose, though somewhat better put
together.</p>
<p>Trust me, dear Yorick, this unwary pleasantry of thine will
sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no
after-wit can extricate thee out of.&mdash;In these sallies, too
oft, I see, it happens, that a person laughed at, considers himself
in the light of a person injured, with all the rights of such a
situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest him in that light
too, and reckons up his friends, his family, his kindred and
allies,&mdash;and musters up with them the many recruits which will
list under him from a sense of common danger;&mdash;'tis no
extravagant arithmetic to say, that for every ten jokes,&mdash;thou
hast got an hundred enemies; and till thou hast gone on, and raised
a swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half stung to death by
them, thou wilt never be convinced it is so.</p>
<p>I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the
least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these
sallies&mdash;I believe and know them to be truly honest and
sportive:&mdash;But consider, my dear lad, that fools cannot
distinguish this,&mdash;and that knaves will not: and thou knowest
not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with
the other:&mdash;whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend
upon it, they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee,
my dear friend, as to make thee heartily sick of it, and of thy
life too.</p>
<p>Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour
at thee, which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall
set right.&mdash;The fortunes of thy house shall totter,&mdash;thy
character, which led the way to them, shall bleed on every side of
it,&mdash;thy faith questioned,&mdash;thy works belied,&mdash;thy
wit forgotten,&mdash;thy learning trampled on. To wind up the last
scene of thy tragedy, Cruelty and Cowardice, twin ruffians, hired
and set on by Malice in the dark, shall strike together at all thy
infirmities and mistakes:&mdash;The best of us, my dear lad, lie
open there,&mdash;and trust me,&mdash;trust me, Yorick, when to
gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved upon, that an
innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, 'tis an easy
matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has
strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with.</p>
<p>Yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny
read over to him, but with a tear stealing from his eye, and a
promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the time to
come, to ride his tit with more sobriety.&mdash;But, alas, too
late!&mdash;a grand confederacy with...and...at the head of it, was
formed before the first prediction of it.&mdash;The whole plan of
the attack, just as Eugenius had foreboded, was put in execution
all at once,&mdash;with so little mercy on the side of the
allies,&mdash;and so little suspicion in Yorick, of what was
carrying on against him,&mdash;that when he thought, good easy man!
full surely preferment was o'ripening,&mdash;they had smote his
root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before
him.</p>
<p>Yorick, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for
some time; till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by
the calamities of the war,&mdash;but more so, by the ungenerous
manner in which it was carried on,&mdash;he threw down the sword;
and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the last, he
died, nevertheless, as was generally thought, quite
broken-hearted.</p>
<p>What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion was as follows:</p>
<p>A few hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius stept in
with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him.
Upon his drawing Yorick's curtain, and asking how he felt himself,
Yorick looking up in his face took hold of his hand,&mdash;and
after thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship to him,
for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet
hereafter,&mdash;he would thank him again and again,&mdash;he told
him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for
ever.&mdash;I hope not, answered Eugenius, with tears trickling
down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man
spoke.&mdash;I hope not, Yorick, said he.&mdash;Yorick replied,
with a look up, and a gentle squeeze of Eugenius's hand, and that
was all,&mdash;but it cut Eugenius to his
heart.&mdash;Come,&mdash;come, Yorick, quoth Eugenius, wiping his
eyes, and summoning up the man within him,&mdash;my dear lad, be
comforted,&mdash;let not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee
at this crisis when thou most wants them;&mdash;who knows what
resources are in store, and what the power of God may yet do for
thee!&mdash;Yorick laid his hand upon his heart, and gently shook
his head;&mdash;For my part, continued Eugenius, crying bitterly as
he uttered the words,&mdash;I declare I know not, Yorick, how to
part with thee, and would gladly flatter my hopes, added Eugenius,
chearing up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to
make a bishop, and that I may live to see it.&mdash;I beseech thee,
Eugenius, quoth Yorick, taking off his night-cap as well as he
could with his left hand,&mdash;his right being still grasped close
in that of Eugenius,&mdash;I beseech thee to take a view of my
head.&mdash;I see nothing that ails it, replied Eugenius. Then,
alas! my friend, said Yorick, let me tell you, that 'tis so bruised
and mis-shapened with the blows which...and..., and some others
have so unhandsomely given me in the dark, that I might say with
Sancho Panca, that should I recover, and 'Mitres thereupon be
suffered to rain down from heaven as thick as hail, not one of them
would fit it.'&mdash;Yorick's last breath was hanging upon his
trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this:&mdash;yet still
it was uttered with something of a Cervantick tone;&mdash;and as he
spoke it, Eugenius could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted
up for a moment in his eyes;&mdash;faint picture of those flashes
of his spirit, which (as Shakespeare said of his ancestor) were
wont to set the table in a roar!</p>
<p>Eugenius was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend
was broke: he squeezed his hand,&mdash;and then walked softly out
of the room, weeping as he walked. Yorick followed Eugenius with
his eyes to the door,&mdash;he then closed them, and never opened
them more.</p>
<p>He lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish
of..., under a plain marble slab, which his friend Eugenius, by
leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than
these three words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph and
elegy. Alas, poor Yorick!</p>
<p>Ten times a day has Yorick's ghost the consolation to hear his
monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive
tones, as denote a general pity and esteem for him;&mdash;a
foot-way crossing the church-yard close by the side of his
grave,&mdash;not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast a
look upon it,&mdash;and sighing as he walks on, Alas, poor
Yorick!</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XIII.</h2>
<p>It is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been
parted from the midwife, that it is high time to mention her again
to him, merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still
in the world, and whom, upon the best judgment I can form upon my
own plan at present, I am going to introduce to him for good and
all: But as fresh matter may be started, and much unexpected
business fall out betwixt the reader and myself, which may require
immediate dispatch;&mdash;'twas right to take care that the poor
woman should not be lost in the mean time;&mdash;because when she
is wanted, we can no way do without her.</p>
<p>I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small
note and consequence throughout our whole village and
township;&mdash;that her fame had spread itself to the very
out-edge and circumference of that circle of importance, of which
kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his back or
no,&mdash;has one surrounding him;&mdash;which said circle, by the
way, whenever 'tis said that such a one is of great weight and
importance in the world,&mdash;I desire may be enlarged or
contracted in your worship's fancy, in a compound ratio of the
station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height and depth
(measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.</p>
<p>In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or
five miles, which not only comprehended the whole parish, but
extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the
skirts of the next parish; which made a considerable thing of it. I
must add, That she was, moreover, very well looked on at one large
grange-house, and some other odd houses and farms within two or
three miles, as I said, from the smoke of her own
chimney:&mdash;But I must here, once for all, inform you, that all
this will be more exactly delineated and explain'd in a map, now in
the hands of the engraver, which, with many other pieces and
developements of this work, will be added to the end of the
twentieth volume,&mdash;not to swell the work,&mdash;I detest the
thought of such a thing;&mdash;but by way of commentary, scholium,
illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or inuendos as
shall be thought to be either of private interpretation, or of dark
or doubtful meaning, after my life and my opinions shall have been
read over (now don't forget the meaning of the word) by all the
world;&mdash;which, betwixt you and me, and in spite of all the
gentlemen-reviewers in Great Britain, and of all that their
worships shall undertake to write or say to the contrary,&mdash;I
am determined shall be the case.&mdash;I need not tell your
worship, that all this is spoke in confidence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XIV.</h2>
<p>Upon looking into my mother's marriage settlement, in order to
satisfy myself and reader in a point necessary to be cleared up,
before we could proceed any farther in this history;&mdash;I had
the good fortune to pop upon the very thing I wanted before I had
read a day and a half straight forwards,&mdash;it might have taken
me up a month;&mdash;which shews plainly, that when a man sits down
to write a history,&mdash;tho' it be but the history of Jack
Hickathrift or Tom Thumb, he knows no more than his heels what lets
and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way,&mdash;or
what a dance he may be led, by one excursion or another, before all
is over. Could a historiographer drive on his history, as a
muleteer drives on his mule,&mdash;straight forward;&mdash;for
instance, from Rome all the way to Loretto, without ever once
turning his head aside, either to the right hand or to the
left,&mdash;he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he
should get to his journey's end;&mdash;but the thing is, morally
speaking, impossible: For, if he is a man of the least spirit, he
will have fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this
or that party as he goes along, which he can no ways avoid. He will
have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting his eye,
which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can
fly; he will moreover have various</p>
<pre>
     Accounts to reconcile:
     Anecdotes to pick up:
     Inscriptions to make out:
     Stories to weave in:
     Traditions to sift:
     Personages to call upon:
     Panegyricks to paste up at this door;
</pre>
<p>Pasquinades at that:&mdash;All which both the man and his mule
are quite exempt from. To sum up all; there are archives at every
stage to be look'd into, and rolls, records, documents, and endless
genealogies, which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the
reading of:&mdash;In short there is no end of it;&mdash;for my own
part, I declare I have been at it these six weeks, making all the
speed I possibly could,&mdash;and am not yet born:&mdash;I have
just been able, and that's all, to tell you when it happen'd, but
not how;&mdash;so that you see the thing is yet far from being
accomplished.</p>
<p>These unforeseen stoppages, which I own I had no conception of
when I first set out;&mdash;but which, I am convinced now, will
rather increase than diminish as I advance,&mdash;have struck out a
hint which I am resolved to follow;&mdash;and that is,&mdash;not to
be in a hurry;&mdash;but to go on leisurely, writing and publishing
two volumes of my life every year;&mdash;which, if I am suffered to
go on quietly, and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller,
I shall continue to do as long as I live.</p>

<p>The article in my mother's marriage-settlement, which I told the
reader I was at the pains to search for, and which, now that I have
found it, I think proper to lay before him,&mdash;is so much more
fully express'd in the deed itself, than ever I can pretend to do
it, that it would be barbarity to take it out of the lawyer's
hand:&mdash;It is as follows.</p>
<p>'And this Indenture further witnesseth, That the said Walter
Shandy, merchant, in consideration of the said intended marriage to
be had, and, by God's blessing, to be well and truly solemnized and
consummated between the said Walter Shandy and Elizabeth Mollineux
aforesaid, and divers other good and valuable causes and
considerations him thereunto specially moving,&mdash;doth grant,
covenant, condescend, consent, conclude, bargain, and fully agree
to and with John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. the above-named
Trustees, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;to wit,&mdash;That in case it
should hereafter so fall out, chance, happen, or otherwise come to
pass,&mdash;That the said Walter Shandy, merchant, shall have left
off business before the time or times, that the said Elizabeth
Mollineux shall, according to the course of nature, or otherwise,
have left off bearing and bringing forth children;&mdash;and that,
in consequence of the said Walter Shandy having so left off
business, he shall in despight, and against the free-will, consent,
and good-liking of the said Elizabeth Mollineux,&mdash;make a
departure from the city of London, in order to retire to, and dwell
upon, his estate at Shandy Hall, in the county of..., or at any
other country-seat, castle, hall, mansion-house, messuage or
grainge-house, now purchased, or hereafter to be purchased, or upon
any part or parcel thereof:&mdash;That then, and as often as the
said Elizabeth Mollineux shall happen to be enceint with child or
children severally and lawfully begot, or to be begotten, upon the
body of the said Elizabeth Mollineux, during her said
coverture,&mdash;he the said Walter Shandy shall, at his own proper
cost and charges, and out of his own proper monies, upon good and
reasonable notice, which is hereby agreed to be within six weeks of
her the said Elizabeth Mollineux's full reckoning, or time of
supposed and computed delivery,&mdash;pay, or cause to be paid, the
sum of one hundred and twenty pounds of good and lawful money, to
John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. or assigns,&mdash;upon Trust
and confidence, and for and unto the use and uses, intent, end, and
purpose following:&mdash;That is to say,&mdash;That the said sum of
one hundred and twenty pounds shall be paid into the hands of the
said Elizabeth Mollineux, or to be otherwise applied by them the
said Trustees, for the well and truly hiring of one coach, with
able and sufficient horses, to carry and convey the body of the
said Elizabeth Mollineux, and the child or children which she shall
be then and there enceint and pregnant with,&mdash;unto the city of
London; and for the further paying and defraying of all other
incidental costs, charges, and expences whatsoever,&mdash;in and
about, and for, and relating to, her said intended delivery and
lying-in, in the said city or suburbs thereof. And that the said
Elizabeth Mollineux shall and may, from time to time, and at all
such time and times as are here covenanted and agreed
upon,&mdash;peaceably and quietly hire the said coach and horses,
and have free ingress, egress, and regress throughout her journey,
in and from the said coach, according to the tenor, true intent,
and meaning of these presents, without any let, suit, trouble,
disturbance, molestation, discharge, hinderance, forfeiture,
eviction, vexation, interruption, or incumbrance
whatsoever.&mdash;And that it shall moreover be lawful to and for
the said Elizabeth Mollineux, from time to time, and as oft or
often as she shall well and truly be advanced in her said
pregnancy, to the time heretofore stipulated and agreed
upon,&mdash;to live and reside in such place or places, and in such
family or families, and with such relations, friends, and other
persons within the said city of London, as she at her own will and
pleasure, notwithstanding her present coverture, and as if she was
a femme sole and unmarried,&mdash;shall think fit.&mdash;And this
Indenture further witnesseth, That for the more effectually
carrying of the said covenant into execution, the said Walter
Shandy, merchant, doth hereby grant, bargain, sell, release, and
confirm unto the said John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. their
heirs, executors, and assigns, in their actual possession now
being, by virtue of an indenture of bargain and sale for a year to
them the said John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. by him the said
Walter Shandy, merchant, thereof made; which said bargain and sale
for a year, bears date the day next before the date of these
presents, and by force and virtue of the statute for transferring
of uses into possession,&mdash;All that the manor and lordship of
Shandy, in the county of..., with all the rights, members, and
appurtenances thereof; and all and every the messuages, houses,
buildings, barns, stables, orchards, gardens, backsides, tofts,
crofts, garths, cottages, lands, meadows, feedings, pastures,
marshes, commons, woods, underwoods, drains, fisheries, waters, and
water-courses;&mdash;together with all rents, reversions, services,
annuities, fee-farms, knights fees, views of frankpledge, escheats,

fugitives, felons of themselves, and put in exigent, deodands, free
warrens, and all other royalties and seigniories, rights and
jurisdictions, privileges and hereditaments whatsoever.&mdash;And
also the advowson, donation, presentation, and free disposition of
the rectory or parsonage of Shandy aforesaid, and all and every the
tenths, tythes, glebe-lands.'&mdash;In three words,&mdash;'My
mother was to lay in (if she chose it) in London.'</p>
<p>But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on
the part of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too
manifestly opened a door to, and which indeed had never been
thought of at all, but for my uncle Toby Shandy;&mdash;a clause was
added in security of my father which was this:&mdash;'That in case
my mother hereafter should, at any time, put my father to the
trouble and expence of a London journey, upon false cries and
tokens;&mdash;that for every such instance, she should forfeit all
the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next
turn;&mdash;but to no more,&mdash;and so on, toties quoties, in as
effectual a manner, as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been
made.'&mdash;This, by the way, was no more than what was
reasonable;&mdash;and yet, as reasonable as it was, I have ever
thought it hard that the whole weight of the article should have
fallen entirely, as it did, upon myself.</p>
<p>But I was begot and born to misfortunes;&mdash;for my poor
mother, whether it was wind or water&mdash;or a compound of
both,&mdash;or neither;&mdash;or whether it was simply the mere
swell of imagination and fancy in her;&mdash;or how far a strong
wish and desire to have it so, might mislead her judgment;&mdash;in
short, whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter, it no
way becomes me to decide. The fact was this, That in the latter end
of September 1717, which was the year before I was born, my mother
having carried my father up to town much against the
grain,&mdash;he peremptorily insisted upon the clause;&mdash;so
that I was doom'd, by marriage-articles, to have my nose squeez'd
as flat to my face, as if the destinies had actually spun me
without one.</p>
<p>How this event came about,&mdash;and what a train of vexatious
disappointments, in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me
from the mere loss, or rather compression, of this one single
member,&mdash;shall be laid before the reader all in due time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XVI.</h2>
<p>My father, as any body may naturally imagine, came down with my
mother into the country, in but a pettish kind of a humour. The
first twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did nothing in the world
but fret and teaze himself, and indeed my mother too, about the
cursed expence, which he said might every shilling of it have been
saved;&mdash;then what vexed him more than every thing else was,
the provoking time of the year,&mdash;which, as I told you, was
towards the end of September, when his wall-fruit and green gages
especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for
pulling:&mdash;'Had he been whistled up to London, upon a Tom
Fool's errand, in any other month of the whole year, he should not
have said three words about it.'</p>
<p>For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the
heavy blow he had sustain'd from the loss of a son, whom it seems
he had fully reckon'd upon in his mind, and register'd down in his
pocket-book, as a second staff for his old age, in case Bobby
should fail him. 'The disappointment of this, he said, was ten
times more to a wise man, than all the money which the journey,
&amp;c. had cost him, put together,&mdash;rot the hundred and
twenty pounds,&mdash;he did not mind it a rush.'</p>
<p>From Stilton, all the way to Grantham, nothing in the whole
affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends, and
the foolish figure they should both make at church, the first
Sunday;&mdash;of which, in the satirical vehemence of his wit, now
sharpen'd a little by vexation, he would give so many humorous and
provoking descriptions,&mdash;and place his rib and self in so many
tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole
congregation;&mdash;that my mother declared, these two stages were
so truly tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a
breath, from one end to the other of them all the way.</p>
<p>From Grantham, till they had cross'd the Trent, my father was
out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which
he fancied my mother had put upon him in this
affair&mdash;'Certainly,' he would say to himself, over and over
again, 'the woman could not be deceived herself&mdash;if she
could,&mdash;what weakness!'&mdash;tormenting word!&mdash;which led
his imagination a thorny dance, and, before all was over, play'd
the duce and all with him;&mdash;for sure as ever the word weakness
was uttered, and struck full upon his brain&mdash;so sure it set
him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses there
were;&mdash;that there was such a thing as weakness of the
body,&mdash;as well as weakness of the mind,&mdash;and then he
would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two
together, How far the cause of all these vexations might, or might
not, have arisen out of himself.</p>
<p>In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude
springing out of this one affair, all fretting successively in his
mind as they rose up in it, that my mother, whatever was her
journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down.&mdash;In a word,
as she complained to my uncle Toby, he would have tired out the
patience of any flesh alive.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XVII.</h2>
<p>Though my father travelled homewards, as I told you, in none of
the best of moods,&mdash;pshawing and pishing all the way
down,&mdash;yet he had the complaisance to keep the worst part of
the story still to himself;&mdash;which was the resolution he had
taken of doing himself the justice, which my uncle Toby's clause in
the marriage-settlement empowered him; nor was it till the very
night in which I was begot, which was thirteen months after, that
she had the least intimation of his design: when my father,
happening, as you remember, to be a little chagrin'd and out of
temper,&mdash;took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed
afterwards, talking over what was to come,&mdash;to let her know
that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the
bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds; which was to
lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year's
journey.</p>
<p>My father was a gentleman of many virtues,&mdash;but he had a
strong spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add
to the number.&mdash;'Tis known by the name of perseverance in a
good cause,&mdash;and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my mother
had so much knowledge, that she knew 'twas to no purpose to make
any remonstrance,&mdash;so she e'en resolved to sit down quietly,
and make the most of it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XVIII.</h2>
<p>As the point was that night agreed, or rather determined, that
my mother should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures
accordingly; for which purpose, when she was three days, or
thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her eyes upon the
midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the
week was well got round, as the famous Dr. Manningham was not to be
had, she had come to a final determination in her
mind,&mdash;notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within
so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had
expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of
midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the
sisterhood itself,&mdash;but had likewise super-added many curious
improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross
births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting
into the world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I say, was
absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no
soul's hand but this old woman's only.&mdash;Now this I
like;&mdash;when we cannot get at the very thing we
wish&mdash;never to take up with the next best in degree to
it:&mdash;no; that's pitiful beyond description;&mdash;it is no
more than a week from this very day, in which I am now writing this
book for the edification of the world;&mdash;which is March 9,
1759,&mdash;that my dear, dear Jenny, observing I looked a little
grave, as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty shillings
a yard,&mdash;told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so
much trouble;&mdash;and immediately went and bought herself a
yard-wide stuff of ten-pence a yard.&mdash;'Tis the duplication of
one and the same greatness of soul; only what lessened the honour
of it, somewhat, in my mother's case, was, that she could not
heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as one in her
situation might have wished, because the old midwife had really
some little claim to be depended upon,&mdash;as much, at least, as
success could give her; having, in the course of her practice of
near twenty years in the parish, brought every mother's son of them
into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly
be laid to her account.</p>
<p>These facts, tho' they had their weight, yet did not altogether
satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my
father's spirits in relation to this choice.&mdash;To say nothing
of the natural workings of humanity and justice&mdash;or of the
yearnings of parental and connubial love, all which prompted him to
leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this
kind;&mdash;he felt himself concerned in a particular manner, that
all should go right in the present case;&mdash;from the accumulated
sorrow he lay open to, should any evil betide his wife and child in
lying-in at Shandy-Hall.&mdash;He knew the world judged by events,
and would add to his afflictions in such a misfortune, by loading
him with the whole blame of it.&mdash;'Alas o'day;&mdash;had Mrs.
Shandy, poor gentlewoman! had but her wish in going up to town just
to lye-in and come down again;&mdash;which they say, she begged and
prayed for upon her bare knees,&mdash;and which, in my opinion,
considering the fortune which Mr. Shandy got with her,&mdash;was no
such mighty matter to have complied with, the lady and her babe
might both of them have been alive at this hour.'</p>
<p>This exclamation, my father knew, was unanswerable;&mdash;and
yet, it was not merely to shelter himself,&mdash;nor was it
altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seemed so
extremely anxious about this point;&mdash;my father had extensive
views of things,&mdash;and stood moreover, as he thought, deeply
concerned in it for the publick good, from the dread he entertained
of the bad uses an ill-fated instance might be put to.</p>
<p>He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject
had unanimously agreed and lamented, from the beginning of Queen
Elizabeth's reign down to his own time, that the current of men and
money towards the metropolis, upon one frivolous errand or
another,&mdash;set in so strong,&mdash;as to become dangerous to
our civil rights,&mdash;though, by the bye,&mdash;a current was not
the image he took most delight in,&mdash;a distemper was here his
favourite metaphor, and he would run it down into a perfect
allegory, by maintaining it was identically the same in the body
national as in the body natural, where the blood and spirits were
driven up into the head faster than they could find their ways
down;&mdash;a stoppage of circulation must ensue, which was death
in both cases.</p>
<p>There was little danger, he would say, of losing our liberties
by French politicks or French invasions;&mdash;nor was he so much
in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and
ulcerated humours in our constitution, which he hoped was not so
bad as it was imagined;&mdash;but he verily feared, that in some
violent push, we should go off, all at once, in a
state-apoplexy;&mdash;and then he would say, The Lord have mercy
upon us all.</p>
<p>My father was never able to give the history of this
distemper,&mdash;without the remedy along with it.</p>
<p>'Was I an absolute prince,' he would say, pulling up his
breeches with both his hands, as he rose from his arm-chair, 'I
would appoint able judges, at every avenue of my metropolis, who
should take cognizance of every fool's business who came
there;&mdash;and if, upon a fair and candid hearing, it appeared
not of weight sufficient to leave his own home, and come up, bag
and baggage, with his wife and children, farmer's sons, &amp;c.
&amp;c. at his backside, they should be all sent back, from
constable to constable, like vagrants as they were, to the place of
their legal settlements. By this means I shall take care, that my
metropolis totter'd not thro' its own weight;&mdash;that the head
be no longer too big for the body;&mdash;that the extremes, now
wasted and pinn'd in, be restored to their due share of
nourishment, and regain with it their natural strength and
beauty:&mdash;I would effectually provide, That the meadows and
corn fields of my dominions, should laugh and sing;&mdash;that good
chear and hospitality flourish once more;&mdash;and that such
weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the
Squirality of my kingdom, as should counterpoise what I perceive my
Nobility are now taking from them.</p>
<p>'Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen's seats,' he would
ask, with some emotion, as he walked across the room, 'throughout
so many delicious provinces in France? Whence is it that the few
remaining Chateaus amongst them are so dismantled,&mdash;so
unfurnished, and in so ruinous and desolate a
condition?&mdash;Because, Sir' (he would say) 'in that kingdom no
man has any country-interest to support;&mdash;the little interest
of any kind which any man has any where in it, is concentrated in
the court, and the looks of the Grand Monarch: by the sunshine of
whose countenance, or the clouds which pass across it, every French
man lives or dies.'</p>
<p>Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to
guard against the least evil accident in my mother's lying-in in
the country,&mdash;was, That any such instance would infallibly
throw a balance of power, too great already, into the weaker
vessels of the gentry, in his own, or higher stations;&mdash;which,
with the many other usurped rights which that part of the
constitution was hourly establishing,&mdash;would, in the end,
prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick government
established in the first creation of things by God.</p>
<p>In this point he was entirely of Sir Robert Filmer's opinion,
That the plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the
eastern parts of the world, were, originally, all stolen from that
admirable pattern and prototype of this houshold and paternal
power;&mdash;which, for a century, he said, and more, had gradually
been degenerating away into a mix'd government;&mdash;the form of
which, however desirable in great combinations of the
species,&mdash;was very troublesome in small ones,&mdash;and seldom
produced any thing, that he saw, but sorrow and confusion.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, private and publick, put
together,&mdash;my father was for having the man-midwife by all
means,&mdash;my mother, by no means. My father begg'd and
intreated, she would for once recede from her prerogative in this
matter, and suffer him to choose for her;&mdash;my mother, on the
contrary, insisted upon her privilege in this matter, to choose for
herself,&mdash;and have no mortal's help but the old
woman's.&mdash;What could my father do? He was almost at his wit's
end;&mdash;talked it over with her in all moods;&mdash;placed his
arguments in all lights;&mdash;argued the matter with her like a
christian,&mdash;like a heathen,&mdash;like a husband,&mdash;like a
father,&mdash;like a patriot,&mdash;like a man:&mdash;My mother
answered every thing only like a woman; which was a little hard
upon her;&mdash;for as she could not assume and fight it out behind
such a variety of characters,&mdash;'twas no fair
match:&mdash;'twas seven to one.&mdash;What could my mother
do?&mdash;She had the advantage (otherwise she had been certainly
overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin personal at the
bottom, which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute the affair
with my father with so equal an advantage,&mdash;that both sides
sung Te Deum. In a word, my mother was to have the old
woman,&mdash;and the operator was to have licence to drink a bottle
of wine with my father and my uncle Toby Shandy in the back
parlour,&mdash;for which he was to be paid five guineas.</p>
<p>I must beg leave, before I finish this chapter, to enter a
caveat in the breast of my fair reader;&mdash;and it is
this,&mdash;Not to take it absolutely for granted, from an
unguarded word or two which I have dropp'd in it,&mdash;'That I am
a married man.'&mdash;I own, the tender appellation of my dear,
dear Jenny,&mdash;with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge,
interspersed here and there, might, naturally enough, have misled
the most candid judge in the world into such a determination
against me.&mdash;All I plead for, in this case, Madam, is strict
justice, and that you do so much of it, to me as well as to
yourself,&mdash;as not to prejudge, or receive such an impression
of me, till you have better evidence, than, I am positive, at
present can be produced against me.&mdash;Not that I can be so vain
or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire you should therefore think,
that my dear, dear Jenny is my kept mistress;&mdash;no,&mdash;that
would be flattering my character in the other extreme, and giving
it an air of freedom, which, perhaps, it has no kind of right to.
All I contend for, is the utter impossibility, for some volumes,
that you, or the most penetrating spirit upon earth, should know
how this matter really stands.&mdash;It is not impossible, but that
my dear, dear Jenny! tender as the appellation is, may be my
child.&mdash;Consider,&mdash;I was born in the year
eighteen.&mdash;Nor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in
the supposition, that my dear Jenny may be my
friend.&mdash;Friend!&mdash;My friend.&mdash;Surely, Madam, a
friendship between the two sexes may subsist, and be supported
without&mdash;Fy! Mr. Shandy:&mdash;Without any thing, Madam, but
that tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship,
where there is a difference of sex. Let me intreat you to study the
pure and sentimental parts of the best French Romances;&mdash;it
will really, Madam, astonish you to see with what a variety of
chaste expressions this delicious sentiment, which I have the
honour to speak of, is dress'd out.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XIX.</h2>
<p>I would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in
geometry, than pretend to account for it, that a gentleman of my
father's great good sense,&mdash;knowing, as the reader must have
observed him, and curious too in philosophy,&mdash;wise also in
political reasoning,&mdash;and in polemical (as he will find) no
way ignorant,&mdash;could be capable of entertaining a notion in
his head, so out of the common track,&mdash;that I fear the reader,
when I come to mention it to him, if he is the least of a cholerick
temper, will immediately throw the book by; if mercurial, he will
laugh most heartily at it;&mdash;and if he is of a grave and
saturnine cast, he will, at first sight, absolutely condemn as
fanciful and extravagant; and that was in respect to the choice and
imposition of christian names, on which he thought a great deal
more depended than what superficial minds were capable of
conceiving.</p>
<p>His opinion, in this matter, was, That there was a strange kind
of magick bias, which good or bad names, as he called them,
irresistibly impressed upon our characters and conduct.</p>
<p>The hero of Cervantes argued not the point with more
seriousness,&mdash;nor had he more faith,&mdash;or more to say on
the powers of necromancy in dishonouring his deeds,&mdash;or on
Dulcinea's name, in shedding lustre upon them, than my father had
on those of Trismegistus or Archimedes, on the one hand&mdash;or of
Nyky and Simkin on the other. How many Caesars and Pompeys, he
would say, by mere inspiration of the names, have been rendered
worthy of them? And how many, he would add, are there, who might
have done exceeding well in the world, had not their characters and
spirits been totally depressed and Nicodemus'd into nothing?</p>
<p>I see plainly, Sir, by your looks, (or as the case happened) my
father would say&mdash;that you do not heartily subscribe to this
opinion of mine,&mdash;which, to those, he would add, who have not
carefully sifted it to the bottom,&mdash;I own has an air more of
fancy than of solid reasoning in it;&mdash;and yet, my dear Sir, if
I may presume to know your character, I am morally assured, I
should hazard little in stating a case to you, not as a party in
the dispute,&mdash;but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon it
to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this
matter;&mdash;you are a person free from as many narrow prejudices
of education as most men;&mdash;and, if I may presume to penetrate
farther into you,&mdash;of a liberality of genius above bearing
down an opinion, merely because it wants friends. Your
son,&mdash;your dear son,&mdash;from whose sweet and open temper
you have so much to expect.&mdash;Your Billy, Sir!&mdash;would you,
for the world, have called him Judas?&mdash;Would you, my dear Sir,
he would say, laying his hand upon your breast, with the genteelest
address,&mdash;and in that soft and irresistible piano of voice,
which the nature of the argumentum ad hominem absolutely
requires,&mdash;Would you, Sir, if a Jew of a godfather had
proposed the name for your child, and offered you his purse along
with it, would you have consented to such a desecration of
him?&mdash;O my God! he would say, looking up, if I know your
temper right, Sir,&mdash;you are incapable of it;&mdash;you would
have trampled upon the offer;&mdash;you would have thrown the
temptation at the tempter's head with abhorrence.</p>
<p>Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that
generous contempt of money, which you shew me in the whole
transaction, is really noble;&mdash;and what renders it more so, is
the principle of it;&mdash;the workings of a parent's love upon the
truth and conviction of this very hypothesis, namely, That was your
son called Judas,&mdash;the forbid and treacherous idea, so
inseparable from the name, would have accompanied him through life
like his shadow, and, in the end, made a miser and a rascal of him,
in spite, Sir, of your example.</p>
<p>I never knew a man able to answer this argument.&mdash;But,
indeed, to speak of my father as he was;&mdash;he was certainly
irresistible;&mdash;both in his orations and disputations;&mdash;he
was born an orator;&mdash;(Greek).&mdash;Persuasion hung upon his
lips, and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up
in him,&mdash;and, withal, he had so shrewd a guess at the
weaknesses and passions of his respondent,&mdash;that Nature might
have stood up and said,&mdash;'This man is eloquent.'&mdash;In
short, whether he was on the weak or the strong side of the
question, 'twas hazardous in either case to attack him.&mdash;And
yet, 'tis strange, he had never read Cicero, nor Quintilian de
Oratore, nor Isocrates, nor Aristotle, nor Longinus, amongst the
antients;&mdash;nor Vossius, nor Skioppius, nor Ramus, nor Farnaby,
amongst the moderns;&mdash;and what is more astonishing, he had
never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty struck
into his mind, by one single lecture upon Crackenthorp or
Burgersdicius or any Dutch logician or commentator;&mdash;he knew
not so much as in what the difference of an argument ad
ignorantiam, and an argument ad hominem consisted; so that I well
remember, when he went up along with me to enter my name at Jesus
College in...,&mdash;it was a matter of just wonder with my worthy
tutor, and two or three fellows of that learned society,&mdash;that
a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools, should be
able to work after that fashion with them.</p>
<p>To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my
father was, however, perpetually forced upon;&mdash;for he had a
thousand little sceptical notions of the comick kind to
defend&mdash;most of which notions, I verily believe, at first
entered upon the footing of mere whims, and of a vive la Bagatelle;
and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or so,
and having sharpened his wit upon them, dismiss them till another
day.</p>
<p>I mention this, not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture
upon the progress and establishment of my father's many odd
opinions,&mdash;but as a warning to the learned reader against the
indiscreet reception of such guests, who, after a free and
undisturbed entrance, for some years, into our brains,&mdash;at
length claim a kind of settlement there,&mdash;working sometimes
like yeast;&mdash;but more generally after the manner of the gentle
passion, beginning in jest,&mdash;but ending in downright
earnest.</p>
<p>Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father's
notions&mdash;or that his judgment, at length, became the dupe of
his wit;&mdash;or how far, in many of his notions, he might, though
odd, be absolutely right;&mdash;the reader, as he comes at them,
shall decide. All that I maintain here, is, that in this one, of
the influence of christian names, however it gained footing, he was
serious;&mdash;he was all uniformity;&mdash;he was systematical,
and, like all systematic reasoners, he would move both heaven and
earth, and twist and torture every thing in nature to support his
hypothesis. In a word I repeat it over again;&mdash;he was
serious;&mdash;and, in consequence of it, he would lose all kind of
patience whenever he saw people, especially of condition, who
should have known better,&mdash;as careless and as indifferent
about the name they imposed upon their child,&mdash;or more so,
than in the choice of Ponto or Cupid for their puppy-dog.</p>
<p>This, he would say, look'd ill;&mdash;and had, moreover, this
particular aggravation in it, viz. That when once a vile name was
wrongfully or injudiciously given, 'twas not like the case of a
man's character, which, when wrong'd, might hereafter be
cleared;&mdash;and, possibly, some time or other, if not in the
man's life, at least after his death,&mdash;be, somehow or other,
set to rights with the world: But the injury of this, he would say,
could never be undone;&mdash;nay, he doubted even whether an act of
parliament could reach it:&mdash;He knew as well as you, that the
legislature assumed a power over surnames;&mdash;but for very
strong reasons, which he could give, it had never yet adventured,
he would say, to go a step farther.</p>
<p>It was observable, that tho' my father, in consequence of this
opinion, had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and
dislikings towards certain names;&mdash;that there were still
numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before him,
that they were absolutely indifferent to him. Jack, Dick, and Tom
were of this class: These my father called neutral
names;&mdash;affirming of them, without a satire, That there had
been as many knaves and fools, at least, as wise and good men,
since the world began, who had indifferently borne them;&mdash;so
that, like equal forces acting against each other in contrary
directions, he thought they mutually destroyed each other's
effects; for which reason, he would often declare, He would not
give a cherry-stone to choose amongst them. Bob, which was my
brother's name, was another of these neutral kinds of christian
names, which operated very little either way; and as my father
happen'd to be at Epsom, when it was given him,&mdash;he would
oft-times thank Heaven it was no worse. Andrew was something like a
negative quantity in Algebra with him;&mdash;'twas worse, he said,
than nothing.&mdash;William stood pretty high:&mdash;Numps again
was low with him:&mdash;and Nick, he said, was the Devil.</p>
<p>But of all names in the universe he had the most unconquerable
aversion for Tristram;&mdash;he had the lowest and most
contemptible opinion of it of any thing in the
world,&mdash;thinking it could possibly produce nothing in rerum
natura, but what was extremely mean and pitiful: So that in the
midst of a dispute on the subject, in which, by the bye, he was
frequently involved,&mdash;he would sometimes break off in a sudden
and spirited Epiphonema, or rather Erotesis, raised a third, and
sometimes a full fifth above the key of the discourse,&mdash;and
demand it categorically of his antagonist, Whether he would take
upon him to say, he had ever remembered,&mdash;whether he had ever
read,&mdash;or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, called
Tristram, performing any thing great or worth
recording?&mdash;No,&mdash;he would say,&mdash;Tristram!&mdash;The
thing is impossible.</p>
<p>What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to
publish this notion of his to the world? Little boots it to the
subtle speculatist to stand single in his opinions,&mdash;unless he
gives them proper vent:&mdash;It was the identical thing which my
father did:&mdash;for in the year sixteen, which was two years
before I was born, he was at the pains of writing an express
Dissertation simply upon the word Tristram,&mdash;shewing the
world, with great candour and modesty, the grounds of his great
abhorrence to the name.</p>
<p>When this story is compared with the title-page,&mdash;Will not
the gentle reader pity my father from his soul?&mdash;to see an
orderly and well-disposed gentleman, who tho' singular,&mdash;yet
inoffensive in his notions,&mdash;so played upon in them by cross
purposes;&mdash;to look down upon the stage, and see him baffled
and overthrown in all his little systems and wishes; to behold a
train of events perpetually falling out against him, and in so
critical and cruel a way, as if they had purposedly been plann'd
and pointed against him, merely to insult his
speculations.&mdash;In a word, to behold such a one, in his old
age, ill-fitted for troubles, ten times in a day suffering
sorrow;&mdash;ten times in a day calling the child of his prayers
Tristram!&mdash;Melancholy dissyllable of sound! which, to his
ears, was unison to Nincompoop, and every name vituperative under
heaven.&mdash;By his ashes! I swear it,&mdash;if ever malignant
spirit took pleasure, or busied itself in traversing the purposes
of mortal man,&mdash;it must have been here;&mdash;and if it was
not necessary I should be born before I was christened, I would
this moment give the reader an account of it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;How could you, Madam, be so inattentive in reading the
last chapter? I told you in it, That my mother was not a
papist.&mdash;Papist! You told me no such thing, Sir.&mdash;Madam,
I beg leave to repeat it over again, that I told you as plain, at
least, as words, by direct inference, could tell you such a
thing.&mdash;Then, Sir, I must have miss'd a page.&mdash;No, Madam,
you have not miss'd a word.&mdash;Then I was asleep, Sir.&mdash;My
pride, Madam, cannot allow you that refuge.&mdash;Then, I declare,
I know nothing at all about the matter.&mdash;That, Madam, is the
very fault I lay to your charge; and as a punishment for it, I do
insist upon it, that you immediately turn back, that is as soon as
you get to the next full stop, and read the whole chapter over
again. I have imposed this penance upon the lady, neither out of
wantonness nor cruelty; but from the best of motives; and therefore
shall make her no apology for it when she returns back:&mdash;'Tis
to rebuke a vicious taste, which has crept into thousands besides
herself,&mdash;of reading straight forwards, more in quest of the
adventures, than of the deep erudition and knowledge which a book
of this cast, if read over as it should be, would infallibly impart
with them&mdash;The mind should be accustomed to make wise
reflections, and draw curious conclusions as it goes along; the
habitude of which made Pliny the younger affirm, 'That he never
read a book so bad, but he drew some profit from it.' The stories
of Greece and Rome, run over without this turn and
application,&mdash;do less service, I affirm it, than the history
of Parismus and Parismenus, or of the Seven Champions of England,
read with it.</p>
<p>&mdash;But here comes my fair lady. Have you read over again the
chapter, Madam, as I desired you?&mdash;You have: And did you not
observe the passage, upon the second reading, which admits the
inference?&mdash;Not a word like it! Then, Madam, be pleased to
ponder well the last line but one of the chapter, where I take upon
me to say, 'It was necessary I should be born before I was
christen'd.' Had my mother, Madam, been a Papist, that consequence
did not follow. (The Romish Rituals direct the baptizing of the
child, in cases of danger, before it is born;&mdash;but upon this
proviso, That some part or other of the child's body be seen by the
baptizer:&mdash;But the Doctors of the Sorbonne, by a deliberation
held amongst them, April 10, 1733,&mdash;have enlarged the powers
of the midwives, by determining, That though no part of the child's
body should appear,&mdash;that baptism shall, nevertheless, be
administered to it by injection,&mdash;par le moyen d'une petite
canulle,&mdash;Anglice a squirt.&mdash;'Tis very strange that St.
Thomas Aquinas, who had so good a mechanical head, both for tying
and untying the knots of school-divinity,&mdash;should, after so
much pains bestowed upon this,&mdash;give up the point at last, as
a second La chose impossible,&mdash;'Infantes in maternis uteris
existentes (quoth St. Thomas!) baptizari possunt nullo
modo.'&mdash;O Thomas! Thomas! If the reader has the curiosity to
see the question upon baptism by injection, as presented to the
Doctors of the Sorbonne, with their consultation thereupon, it is
as follows.)</p>
<p>It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine, but more
so to the Republick of letters;&mdash;so that my own is quite
swallowed up in the consideration of it,&mdash;that this self-same
vile pruriency for fresh adventures in all things, has got so
strongly into our habit and humour,&mdash;and so wholly intent are
we upon satisfying the impatience of our concupiscence that
way,&mdash;that nothing but the gross and more carnal parts of a
composition will go down:&mdash;The subtle hints and sly
communications of science fly off, like spirits upwards,&mdash;the
heavy moral escapes downwards; and both the one and the other are
as much lost to the world, as if they were still left in the bottom
of the ink-horn.</p>
<p>I wish the male-reader has not pass'd by many a one, as quaint
and curious as this one, in which the female-reader has been
detected. I wish it may have its effects;&mdash;and that all good
people, both male and female, from example, may be taught to think
as well as read.</p>
<p>Memoire presente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne</p>
<p>Vide Deventer. Paris Edit. 4to, 1734, p. 366.</p>
<p>Un Chirurgien Accoucheur, represente a Messieurs les Docteurs de
Sorbonne, qu'il y a des cas, quoique tres rares, ou une mere ne
scauroit accoucher, &amp; meme ou l'enfant est tellement renferme
dans le sein de sa mere, qu'il ne fait paroitre aucune partie de
son corps, ce qui seroit un cas, suivant les Rituels, de lui
conferer, du moins sous condition, le bapteme. Le Chirurgien, qui
consulte, pretend, par le moyen d'une petite canulle, de pouvoir
baptiser immediatement l'enfant, sans faire aucun tort a la
mere.&mdash;Il demand si ce moyen, qu'il vient de proposer, est
permis &amp; legitime, &amp; s'il peut s'en servir dans les cas
qu'il vient d'exposer.</p>
<p>Reponse</p>
<p>Le Conseil estime, que la question proposee souffre de grandes
difficultes. Les Theologiens posent d'un cote pour principe, que le
bapteme, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere
naissance; il faut etre ne dans le monde, pour renaitre en Jesus
Christ, comme ils l'enseignent. S. Thomas, 3 part. quaest. 88
artic. II. suit cette doctrine comme une verite constante; l'on ne
peut, dit ce S. Docteur, baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermes
dans le sein de leurs meres, &amp; S. Thomas est fonde sur ce, que
les enfans ne sont point nes, &amp; ne peuvent etre comptes parmi
les autres hommes; d'ou il conclud, qu'ils ne peuvent etre l'objet
d'une action exterieure, pour recevoir par leur ministere, les
sacremens necessaires au salut: Pueri in maternis uteris existentes
nondum prodierunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant;
unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae, ut per eorum ministerium
sacramenta recipiant ad salutem. Les rituels ordonnent dans la
pratique ce que les theologiens ont etabli sur les memes matieres,
&amp; ils deffendent tous d'une maniere uniforme, de baptiser les
enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, s'ils ne
sont paroitre quelque partie de leurs corps. Le concours des
theologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les regles des dioceses,
paroit former une autorite qui termine la question presente;
cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d'un cote, que le
raisonnement des theologiens est uniquement fonde sur une raison de
convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l'on ne
peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermes dans le sein
de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp;
d'un autre cote, considerant que les memes theologiens enseignent,
que l'on peut risquer les sacremens que Jesus Christ a etablis
comme des moyens faciles, mais necessaires pour sanctifier les
hommes; &amp; d'ailleurs estimant, que les enfans renfermes dans le
sein de leurs meres, pourroient etre capables de salut, parcequ'ils
sont capables de damnation;&mdash;pour ces considerations, &amp; en
egard a l'expose, suivant lequel on assure avoir trouve un moyen
certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renfermes, sans faire aucun
tort a la mere, le Conseil estime que l'on pourroit se servir du
moyen propose, dans la confiance qu'il a, que Dieu n'a point laisse
ces sortes d'enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp; supposant, comme il
est expose, que le moyen dont il s'agit est propre a leur procurer
le bapteme; cependant comme il s'agiroit, en autorisant la pratique
proposee, de changer une regle universellement etablie, le Conseil
croit que celui qui consulte doit s'addresser a son eveque, &amp; a
qui il appartient de juger de l'utilite, &amp; du danger du moyen
propose, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l'eveque, le Conseil
estime qu'il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d'expliquer
les regles de l'eglise, &amp; d'y deroger dans le cas, ou la loi ne
scauroit obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la
maniere de baptiser dont il s'agit, le Conseil ne pourroit
l'approver sans le concours de ces deux autorites. On conseile au
moins a celui qui consulte, de s'addresser a son eveque, &amp; de
lui faire part de la presente decision, afin que, si le prelat
entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussignes
s'appuyent, il puisse etre autorise dans le cas de necessite, ou il
risqueroit trop d'attendre que la permission fut demandee &amp;
accordee d'employer le moyen qu'il propose si avantageux au salut
de l'enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l'on pourroit
s'en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il s'agit,
venoient au monde, contre l'esperance de ceux qui se seroient
servis du meme moyen, il seroit necessaire de les baptiser sous
condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme a tous les rituels,
qui en autorisant le bapteme d'un enfant qui fait paroitre quelque
partie de son corps, enjoignent neantmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le
baptiser sous condition, s'il vient heureusement au monde.</p>

<p>Mr. Tristram Shandy's compliments to Messrs. Le Moyne, De
Romigny, and De Marcilly; hopes they all rested well the night
after so tiresome a consultation.&mdash;He begs to know, whether
after the ceremony of marriage, and before that of consummation,
the baptizing all the Homunculi at once, slapdash, by injection,
would not be a shorter and safer cut still; on condition, as above,
That if the Homunculi do well, and come safe into the world after
this, that each and every of them shall be baptized again (sous
condition)&mdash;And provided, in the second place, That the thing
can be done, which Mr. Shandy apprehends it may, par le moyen d'une
petite canulle, and sans faire aucune tort au pere.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXI.</h2>
<p>&mdash;I wonder what's all that noise, and running backwards and
forwards for, above stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself,
after an hour and a half's silence, to my uncle Toby,&mdash;who,
you must know, was sitting on the opposite side of the fire,
smoaking his social pipe all the time, in mute contemplation of a
new pair of black plush-breeches which he had got on:&mdash;What
can they be doing, brother?&mdash;quoth my father,&mdash;we can
scarce hear ourselves talk.</p>
<p>I think, replied my uncle Toby, taking his pipe from his mouth,
and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his
left thumb, as he began his sentence,&mdash;I think, says
he:&mdash;But to enter rightly into my uncle Toby's sentiments upon
this matter, you must be made to enter first a little into his
character, the out-lines of which I shall just give you, and then
the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well
again.</p>
<p>Pray what was that man's name,&mdash;for I write in such a
hurry, I have no time to recollect or look for it,&mdash;who first
made the observation, 'That there was great inconstancy in our air
and climate?' Whoever he was, 'twas a just and good observation in
him.&mdash;But the corollary drawn from it, namely, 'That it is
this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and
whimsical characters;'&mdash;that was not his;&mdash;it was found
out by another man, at least a century and a half after him: Then
again,&mdash;that this copious store-house of original materials,
is the true and natural cause that our Comedies are so much better
than those of France, or any others that either have, or can be
wrote upon the Continent:&mdash;that discovery was not fully made
till about the middle of King William's reign,&mdash;when the great
Dryden, in writing one of his long prefaces, (if I mistake not)
most fortunately hit upon it. Indeed toward the latter end of queen
Anne, the great Addison began to patronize the notion, and more
fully explained it to the world in one or two of his
Spectators;&mdash;but the discovery was not his.&mdash;Then,
fourthly and lastly, that this strange irregularity in our climate,
producing so strange an irregularity in our characters,&mdash;doth
thereby, in some sort, make us amends, by giving us somewhat to
make us merry with when the weather will not suffer us to go out of
doors,&mdash;that observation is my own;&mdash;and was struck out
by me this very rainy day, March 26, 1759, and betwixt the hours of
nine and ten in the morning.</p>
<p>Thus&mdash;thus, my fellow-labourers and associates in this
great harvest of our learning, now ripening before our eyes; thus
it is, by slow steps of casual increase, that our knowledge
physical, metaphysical, physiological, polemical, nautical,
mathematical, aenigmatical, technical, biographical, romantical,
chemical, and obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it, (most
of 'em ending as these do, in ical) have for these two last
centuries and more, gradually been creeping upwards towards that
Akme of their perfections, from which, if we may form a conjecture
from the advances of these last seven years, we cannot possibly be
far off.</p>
<p>When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all
kind of writings whatsoever;&mdash;the want of all kind of writing
will put an end to all kind of reading;&mdash;and that in time, As
war begets poverty; poverty peace,&mdash;must, in course, put an
end to all kind of knowledge,&mdash;and then&mdash;we shall have
all to begin over again; or, in other words, be exactly where we
started.</p>
<p>&mdash;Happy! Thrice happy times! I only wish that the aera of
my begetting, as well as the mode and manner of it, had been a
little alter'd,&mdash;or that it could have been put off, with any
convenience to my father or mother, for some twenty or
five-and-twenty years longer, when a man in the literary world
might have stood some chance.&mdash;</p>
<p>But I forget my uncle Toby, whom all this while we have left
knocking the ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.</p>
<p>His humour was of that particular species, which does honour to
our atmosphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him
amongst one of the first-rate productions of it, had not there
appeared too many strong lines in it of a family-likeness, which
shewed that he derived the singularity of his temper more from
blood, than either wind or water, or any modifications or
combinations of them whatever: And I have, therefore, oft-times
wondered, that my father, tho' I believe he had his reasons for it,
upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity, in my course, when
I was a boy,&mdash;should never once endeavour to account for them
in this way: for all the Shandy Family were of an original
character throughout:&mdash;I mean the males,&mdash;the females had
no character at all,&mdash;except, indeed, my great aunt Dinah,
who, about sixty years ago, was married and got with child by the
coachman, for which my father, according to his hypothesis of
christian names, would often say, She might thank her godfathers
and godmothers.</p>
<p>It will seem strange,&mdash;and I would as soon think of
dropping a riddle in the reader's way, which is not my interest to
do, as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass, that an
event of this kind, so many years after it had happened, should be
reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity, which
otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my father and my uncle
Toby. One would have thought, that the whole force of the
misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at
first,&mdash;as is generally the case.&mdash;But nothing ever
wrought with our family after the ordinary way. Possibly at the
very time this happened, it might have something else to afflict
it; and as afflictions are sent down for our good, and that as this
had never done the Shandy Family any good at all, it might lie
waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an
opportunity to discharge its office.&mdash;Observe, I determine
nothing upon this.&mdash;My way is ever to point out to the
curious, different tracts of investigation, to come at the first
springs of the events I tell;&mdash;not with a pedantic
Fescue,&mdash;or in the decisive manner or Tacitus, who outwits
himself and his reader;&mdash;but with the officious humility of a
heart devoted to the assistance merely of the inquisitive;&mdash;to
them I write,&mdash;and by them I shall be read,&mdash;if any such
reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long,&mdash;to the
very end of the world.</p>
<p>Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my
father and uncle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what
direction it exerted itself so as to become the cause of
dissatisfaction between them, after it began to operate, is what I
am able to explain with great exactness, and is as follows:</p>
<p>My uncle Toby Shandy, Madam, was a gentleman, who, with the
virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of honour
and rectitude,&mdash;possessed one in a very eminent degree, which
is seldom or never put into the catalogue; and that was a most
extreme and unparallel'd modesty of nature;&mdash;though I correct
the word nature, for this reason, that I may not prejudge a point
which must shortly come to a hearing, and that is, Whether this
modesty of his was natural or acquir'd.&mdash;Whichever way my
uncle Toby came by it, 'twas nevertheless modesty in the truest
sense of it; and that is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was
so unhappy as to have very little choice in them,&mdash;but to
things;&mdash;and this kind of modesty so possessed him, and it
arose to such a height in him, as almost to equal, if such a thing
could be, even the modesty of a woman: That female nicety, Madam,
and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which makes
you so much the awe of ours.</p>
<p>You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle Toby had contracted all
this from this very source;&mdash;that he had spent a great part of
his time in converse with your sex, and that from a thorough
knowledge of you, and the force of imitation which such fair
examples render irresistible, he had acquired this amiable turn of
mind.</p>
<p>I wish I could say so,&mdash;for unless it was with his
sister-in-law, my father's wife and my mother&mdash;my uncle Toby
scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many
years;&mdash;no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.&mdash;A
blow!&mdash;Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke
off by a ball from the parapet of a horn-work at the siege of
Namur, which struck full upon my uncle Toby's groin.&mdash;Which
way could that effect it? The story of that, Madam, is long and
interesting;&mdash;but it would be running my history all upon
heaps to give it you here.&mdash;'Tis for an episode hereafter; and
every circumstance relating to it, in its proper place, shall be
faithfully laid before you:&mdash;'Till then, it is not in my power
to give farther light into this matter, or say more than what I
have said already,&mdash;That my uncle Toby was a gentleman of
unparallel'd modesty, which happening to be somewhat subtilized and
rarified by the constant heat of a little family pride,&mdash;they
both so wrought together within him, that he could never bear to
hear the affair of my aunt Dinah touch'd upon, but with the
greatest emotion.&mdash;The least hint of it was enough to make the
blood fly into his face;&mdash;but when my father enlarged upon the
story in mixed companies, which the illustration of his hypothesis
frequently obliged him to do,&mdash;the unfortunate blight of one
of the fairest branches of the family, would set my uncle Toby's
honour and modesty o'bleeding; and he would often take my father
aside, in the greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell
him, he would give him any thing in the world, only to let the
story rest.</p>
<p>My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my
uncle Toby, that ever one brother bore towards another, and would
have done any thing in nature, which one brother in reason could
have desir'd of another, to have made my uncle Toby's heart easy in
this, or any other point. But this lay out of his power.</p>
<p>&mdash;My father, as I told you was a philosopher in
grain,&mdash;speculative,&mdash;systematical;&mdash;and my aunt
Dinah's affair was a matter of as much consequence to him, as the
retrogradation of the planets to Copernicus:&mdash;The backslidings
of Venus in her orbit fortified the Copernican system, called so
after his name; and the backslidings of my aunt Dinah in her orbit,
did the same service in establishing my father's system, which, I
trust, will for ever hereafter be called the Shandean System, after
his.</p>
<p>In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice
a sense of shame as any man whatever;&mdash;and neither he, nor, I
dare say, Copernicus, would have divulged the affair in either
case, or have taken the least notice of it to the world, but for
the obligations they owed, as they thought, to truth.&mdash;Amicus
Plato, my father would say, construing the words to my uncle Toby,
as he went along, Amicus Plato; that is, Dinah was my
aunt;&mdash;sed magis amica veritas&mdash;but Truth is my
sister.</p>
<p>This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was
the source of many a fraternal squabble. The one could not bear to
hear the tale of family disgrace recorded,&mdash;and the other
would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at
it.</p>
<p>For God's sake, my uncle Toby would cry,&mdash;and for my sake,
and for all our sakes, my dear brother Shandy,&mdash;do let this
story of our aunt's and her ashes sleep in peace;&mdash;how can
you,&mdash;how can you have so little feeling and compassion for
the character of our family?&mdash;What is the character of a
family to an hypothesis? my father would reply.&mdash;Nay, if you
come to that&mdash;what is the life of a family?&mdash;The life of
a family!&mdash;my uncle Toby would say, throwing himself back in
his arm chair, and lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one
leg&mdash;Yes, the life,&mdash;my father would say, maintaining his
point. How many thousands of 'em are there every year that come
cast away, (in all civilized countries at least)&mdash;and
considered as nothing but common air, in competition of an
hypothesis. In my plain sense of things, my uncle Toby would
answer,&mdash;every such instance is downright Murder, let who will
commit it.&mdash;There lies your mistake, my father would
reply;&mdash;for, in Foro Scientiae there is no such thing as
Murder,&mdash;'tis only Death, brother.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind
of argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of
Lillebullero.&mdash;You must know it was the usual channel thro'
which his passions got vent, when any thing shocked or surprized
him:&mdash;but especially when any thing, which he deem'd very
absurd, was offered.</p>
<p>As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators
upon them, that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to
this particular species of argument.&mdash;I here take the liberty
to do it myself, for two reasons. First, That, in order to prevent
all confusion in disputes, it may stand as much distinguished for
ever, from every other species of argument&mdash;as the Argumentum
ad Verecundiam, ex Absurdo, ex Fortiori, or any other argument
whatsoever:&mdash;And, secondly, That it may be said by my
children's children, when my head is laid to rest,&mdash;that their
learn'd grandfather's head had been busied to as much purpose once,
as other people's;&mdash;That he had invented a name, and
generously thrown it into the Treasury of the Ars Logica, for one
of the most unanswerable arguments in the whole science. And, if
the end of disputation is more to silence than convince,&mdash;they
may add, if they please, to one of the best arguments too.</p>
<p>I do, therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command,
That it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the
Argumentum Fistulatorium, and no other;&mdash;and that it rank
hereafter with the Argumentum Baculinum and the Argumentum ad
Crumenam, and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same
chapter.</p>
<p>As for the Argumentum Tripodium, which is never used but by the
woman against the man;&mdash;and the Argumentum ad Rem, which,
contrarywise, is made use of by the man only against the
woman;&mdash;As these two are enough in conscience for one
lecture;&mdash;and, moreover, as the one is the best answer to the
other,&mdash;let them likewise be kept apart, and be treated of in
a place by themselves.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXII.</h2>
<p>The learned Bishop Hall, I mean the famous Dr. Joseph Hall, who
was Bishop of Exeter in King James the First's reign, tells us in
one of Decads, at the end of his divine art of meditation,
imprinted at London, in the year 1610, by John Beal, dwelling in
Aldersgate-street, 'That it is an abominable thing for a man to
commend himself;'&mdash;and I really think it is so.</p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a
masterly kind of a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found
out;&mdash;I think it is full as abominable, that a man should lose
the honour of it, and go out of the world with the conceit of it
rotting in his head.</p>
<p>This is precisely my situation.</p>
<pre>
 For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into, as in all
my digressions (one only excepted) there is a master-stroke of
digressive skill, the merit of which has all along, I fear, been
over-looked by my reader,&mdash;not for want of penetration in him,&mdash;but
because 'tis an excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a
digression;&mdash;and it is this: That tho' my digressions are all fair, as
you observe,&mdash;and that I fly off from what I am about, as far, and as
often too, as any writer in Great Britain; yet I constantly take care
to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my
absence.
</pre>
<p>I was just going, for example, to have given you the great
out-lines of my uncle Toby's most whimsical character;&mdash;when
my aunt Dinah and the coachman came across us, and led us a vagary
some millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system:
Notwithstanding all this, you perceive that the drawing of my uncle
Toby's character went on gently all the time;&mdash;not the great
contours of it,&mdash;that was impossible,&mdash;but some familiar
strokes and faint designations of it, were here and there touch'd
on, as we went along, so that you are much better acquainted with
my uncle Toby now than you was before.</p>
<p>By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by
itself; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and
reconciled, which were thought to be at variance with each other.
In a word, my work is digressive, and it is progressive
too,&mdash;and at the same time.</p>
<p>This, Sir, is a very different story from that of the earth's
moving round her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her progress
in her elliptick orbit which brings about the year, and constitutes
that variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoy;&mdash;though I
own it suggested the thought,&mdash;as I believe the greatest of
our boasted improvements and discoveries have come from such
trifling hints.</p>
<p>Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine;&mdash;they are the
life, the soul of reading!&mdash;take them out of this book, for
instance,&mdash;you might as well take the book along with
them;&mdash;one cold eternal winter would reign in every page of
it; restore them to the writer;&mdash;he steps forth like a
bridegroom,&mdash;bids All-hail; brings in variety, and forbids the
appetite to fail.</p>
<p>All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them,
so as to be not only for the advantage of the reader, but also of
the author, whose distress, in this matter, is truly pitiable: For,
if he begins a digression,&mdash;from that moment, I observe, his
whole work stands stock still;&mdash;and if he goes on with his
main work,&mdash;then there is an end of his digression.</p>
<p>&mdash;This is vile work.&mdash;For which reason, from the
beginning of this, you see, I have constructed the main work and
the adventitious parts of it with such intersections, and have so
complicated and involved the digressive and progressive movements,
one wheel within another, that the whole machine, in general, has
been kept a-going;&mdash;and, what's more, it shall be kept a-going
these forty years, if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me
so long with life and good spirits.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXIII.</h2>
<p>I have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very
nonsensically, and I will not balk my fancy.&mdash;Accordingly I
set off thus:</p>
<p>If the fixture of Momus's glass in the human breast, according
to the proposed emendation of that arch-critick, had taken
place,&mdash;first, This foolish consequence would certainly have
followed,&mdash;That the very wisest and very gravest of us all, in
one coin or other, must have paid window-money every day of our
lives.</p>
<p>And, secondly, that had the said glass been there set up,
nothing more would have been wanting, in order to have taken a
man's character, but to have taken a chair and gone softly, as you
would to a dioptrical bee-hive, and look'd in,&mdash;view'd the
soul stark naked;&mdash;observed all her motions,&mdash;her
machinations;&mdash;traced all her maggots from their first
engendering to their crawling forth;&mdash;watched her loose in her
frisks, her gambols, her capricios; and after some notice of her
more solemn deportment, consequent upon such frisks,
&amp;c.&mdash;then taken your pen and ink and set down nothing but
what you had seen, and could have sworn to:&mdash;But this is an
advantage not to be had by the biographer in this planet;&mdash;in
the planet Mercury (belike) it may be so, if not better still for
him;&mdash;for there the intense heat of the country, which is
proved by computators, from its vicinity to the sun, to be more
than equal to that of red-hot iron,&mdash;must, I think, long ago
have vitrified the bodies of the inhabitants, (as the efficient
cause) to suit them for the climate (which is the final cause;) so
that betwixt them both, all the tenements of their souls, from top
to bottom, may be nothing else, for aught the soundest philosophy
can shew to the contrary, but one fine transparent body of clear
glass (bating the umbilical knot)&mdash;so that, till the
inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of
light, in passing through them, become so monstrously
refracted,&mdash;or return reflected from their surfaces in such
transverse lines to the eye, that a man cannot be seen
through;&mdash;his soul might as well, unless for mere ceremony, or
the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave
her,&mdash;might, upon all other accounts, I say, as well play the
fool out o'doors as in her own house.</p>
<p>But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of
this earth;&mdash;our minds shine not through the body, but are
wrapt up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood;
so that, if we would come to the specific characters of them, we
must go some other way to work.</p>
<p>Many, in good truth, are the ways, which human wit has been
forced to take, to do this thing with exactness.</p>
<p>Some, for instance, draw all their characters with
wind-instruments.&mdash;Virgil takes notice of that way in the
affair of Dido and Aeneas;&mdash;but it is as fallacious as the
breath of fame;&mdash;and, moreover, bespeaks a narrow genius. I am
not ignorant that the Italians pretend to a mathematical exactness
in their designations of one particular sort of character among
them, from the forte or piano of a certain wind-instrument they
use,&mdash;which they say is infallible.&mdash;I dare not mention
the name of the instrument in this place;&mdash;'tis sufficient we
have it amongst us,&mdash;but never think of making a drawing by
it;&mdash;this is aenigmatical, and intended to be so, at least ad
populum:&mdash;And therefore, I beg, Madam, when you come here,
that you read on as fast as you can, and never stop to make any
inquiry about it.</p>
<p>There are others again, who will draw a man's character from no
other helps in the world, but merely from his
evacuations;&mdash;but this often gives a very incorrect
outline,&mdash;unless, indeed, you take a sketch of his repletions
too; and by correcting one drawing from the other, compound one
good figure out of them both.</p>
<p>I should have no objection to this method, but that I think it
must smell too strong of the lamp,&mdash;and be render'd still more
operose, by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of his
Non-naturals.&mdash;Why the most natural actions of a man's life
should be called his Non-naturals,&mdash;is another question.</p>
<p>There are others, fourthly, who disdain every one of these
expedients;&mdash;not from any fertility of their own, but from the
various ways of doing it, which they have borrowed from the
honourable devices which the Pentagraphic Brethren (Pentagraph, an
instrument to copy Prints and Pictures mechanically, and in any
proportion.) of the brush have shewn in taking copies.&mdash;These,
you must know, are your great historians.</p>
<p>One of these you will see drawing a full length character
against the light;&mdash;that's
illiberal,&mdash;dishonest,&mdash;and hard upon the character of
the man who sits.</p>
<p>Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the
Camera;&mdash;that is most unfair of all, because, there you are
sure to be represented in some of your most ridiculous
attitudes.</p>
<p>To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my
uncle Toby's character, I am determined to draw it by no mechanical
help whatever;&mdash;nor shall my pencil be guided by any one
wind-instrument which ever was blown upon, either on this, or on
the other side of the Alps;&mdash;nor will I consider either his
repletions or his discharges,&mdash;or touch upon his Non-naturals;
but, in a word, I will draw my uncle Toby's character from his
Hobby-Horse.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXIV.</h2>
<p>If I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all
patience for my uncle Toby's character,&mdash;I would here
previously have convinced him that there is no instrument so fit to
draw such a thing with, as that which I have pitch'd upon.</p>
<p>A man and his Hobby-Horse, tho' I cannot say that they act and
re-act exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do
upon each other: Yet doubtless there is a communication between
them of some kind; and my opinion rather is, that there is
something in it more of the manner of electrified bodies,&mdash;and
that, by means of the heated parts of the rider, which come
immediately into contact with the back of the Hobby-Horse,&mdash;by
long journies and much friction, it so happens, that the body of
the rider is at length fill'd as full of Hobby-Horsical matter as
it can hold;&mdash;so that if you are able to give but a clear
description of the nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact
notion of the genius and character of the other.</p>
<p>Now the Hobby-Horse which my uncle Toby always rode upon, was in
my opinion an Hobby-Horse well worth giving a description of, if it
was only upon the score of his great singularity;&mdash;for you
might have travelled from York to Dover,&mdash;from Dover to
Penzance in Cornwall, and from Penzance to York back again, and not
have seen such another upon the road; or if you had seen such a
one, whatever haste you had been in, you must infallibly have
stopp'd to have taken a view of him. Indeed, the gait and figure of
him was so strange, and so utterly unlike was he, from his head to
his tail, to any one of the whole species, that it was now and then
made a matter of dispute,&mdash;whether he was really a Hobby-Horse
or no: But as the Philosopher would use no other argument to the
Sceptic, who disputed with him against the reality of motion, save
that of rising up upon his legs, and walking across the
room;&mdash;so would my uncle Toby use no other argument to prove
his Hobby-Horse was a Hobby-Horse indeed, but by getting upon his
back and riding him about;&mdash;leaving the world, after that, to
determine the point as it thought fit.</p>
<p>In good truth, my uncle Toby mounted him with so much pleasure,
and he carried my uncle Toby so well,&mdash;that he troubled his
head very little with what the world either said or thought about
it.</p>
<p>It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of
him:&mdash;But to go on regularly, I only beg you will give me
leave to acquaint you first, how my uncle Toby came by him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXV.</h2>
<p>The wound in my uncle Toby's groin, which he received at the
siege of Namur, rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought
expedient he should return to England, in order, if possible, to be
set to rights.</p>
<p>He was four years totally confined,&mdash;part of it to his bed,
and all of it to his room: and in the course of his cure, which was
all that time in hand, suffer'd unspeakable miseries,&mdash;owing
to a succession of exfoliations from the os pubis, and the outward
edge of that part of the coxendix called the os illium,&mdash;both
which bones were dismally crush'd, as much by the irregularity of
the stone, which I told you was broke off the parapet,&mdash;as by
its size,&mdash;(tho' it was pretty large) which inclined the
surgeon all along to think, that the great injury which it had done
my uncle Toby's groin, was more owing to the gravity of the stone
itself, than to the projectile force of it,&mdash;which he would
often tell him was a great happiness.</p>
<p>My father at that time was just beginning business in London,
and had taken a house;&mdash;and as the truest friendship and
cordiality subsisted between the two brothers,&mdash;and that my
father thought my uncle Toby could no where be so well nursed and
taken care of as in his own house,&mdash;he assign'd him the very
best apartment in it.&mdash;And what was a much more sincere mark
of his affection still, he would never suffer a friend or an
acquaintance to step into the house on any occasion, but he would
take him by the hand, and lead him up stairs to see his brother
Toby, and chat an hour by his bed-side.</p>
<p>The history of a soldier's wound beguiles the pain of
it;&mdash;my uncle's visitors at least thought so, and in their
daily calls upon him, from the courtesy arising out of that belief,
they would frequently turn the discourse to that subject,&mdash;and
from that subject the discourse would generally roll on to the
siege itself.</p>
<p>These conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle Toby
received great relief from them, and would have received much more,
but that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities, which,
for three months together, retarded his cure greatly; and if he had
not hit upon an expedient to extricate himself out of them, I
verily believe they would have laid him in his grave.</p>
<p>What these perplexities of my uncle Toby were,&mdash;'tis
impossible for you to guess;&mdash;if you could,&mdash;I should
blush; not as a relation,&mdash;not as a man,&mdash;nor even as a
woman,&mdash;but I should blush as an author; inasmuch as I set no
small store by myself upon this very account, that my reader has
never yet been able to guess at any thing. And in this, Sir, I am
of so nice and singular a humour, that if I thought you was able to
form the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself, of what
was to come in the next page,&mdash;I would tear it out of my
book.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXVI.</h2>
<p>I have begun a new book, on purpose that I might have room
enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle
Toby was involved, from the many discourses and interrogations
about the siege of Namur, where he received his wound.</p>
<p>I must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of
King William's wars,&mdash;but if he has not,&mdash;I then inform
him, that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege, was that
which was made by the English and Dutch upon the point of the
advanced counterscarp, between the gate of St. Nicolas, which
inclosed the great sluice or water-stop, where the English were
terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard and demi-bastion
of St. Roch: The issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was
this; That the Dutch lodged themselves upon the
counter-guard,&mdash;and that the English made themselves masters
of the covered-way before St. Nicolas-gate, notwithstanding the
gallantry of the French officers, who exposed themselves upon the
glacis sword in hand.</p>
<p>As this was the principal attack of which my uncle Toby was an
eye-witness at Namur,&mdash;the army of the besiegers being cut
off, by the confluence of the Maes and Sambre, from seeing much of
each other's operations,&mdash;my uncle Toby was generally more
eloquent and particular in his account of it; and the many
perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable
difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving
such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the
scarp and counterscarp,&mdash;the glacis and covered-way,&mdash;the
half-moon and ravelin,&mdash;as to make his company fully
comprehend where and what he was about.</p>
<p>Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms; so that
you will the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and
in opposition to many misconceptions, that my uncle Toby did
oft-times puzzle his visitors, and sometimes himself too.</p>
<p>To speak the truth, unless the company my father led up stairs
were tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle Toby was in one of his
explanatory moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to
keep the discourse free from obscurity.</p>
<p>What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to
my uncle Toby, was this,&mdash;that in the attack of the
counterscarp, before the gate of St. Nicolas, extending itself from
the bank of the Maes, quite up to the great water-stop,&mdash;the
ground was cut and cross cut with such a multitude of dykes,
drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,&mdash;and he would get
so sadly bewildered, and set fast amongst them, that frequently he
could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life; and was
oft-times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account
only.</p>
<p>These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle Toby Shandy more
perturbations than you would imagine; and as my father's kindness
to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh
enquirers,&mdash;he had but a very uneasy task of it.</p>
<p>No doubt my uncle Toby had great command of himself,&mdash;and
could guard appearances, I believe, as well as most men;&mdash;yet
any one may imagine, that when he could not retreat out of the
ravelin without getting into the half-moon, or get out of the
covered-way without falling down the counterscarp, nor cross the
dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch, but that he must
have fretted and fumed inwardly:&mdash;He did so;&mdash;and the
little and hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and of no
account to the man who has not read Hippocrates, yet, whoever has
read Hippocrates, or Dr. James Mackenzie, and has considered well
the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon
the digestion&mdash;(Why not of a wound as well as of a
dinner?)&mdash;may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms and
exacerbations of his wound my uncle Toby must have undergone upon
that score only.</p>
<p>&mdash;My uncle Toby could not philosophize upon it;&mdash;'twas
enough he felt it was so,&mdash;and having sustained the pain and
sorrows of it for three months together, he was resolved some way
or other to extricate himself.</p>
<p>He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish
and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no
other position, when a thought came into his head, that if he could
purchase such a thing, and have it pasted down upon a board, as a
large map of the fortification of the town and citadel of Namur,
with its environs, it might be a means of giving him ease.&mdash;I
take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town
and citadel, for this reason,&mdash;because my uncle Toby's wound
was got in one of the traverses, about thirty toises from the
returning angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the
demi-bastion of St. Roch:&mdash;so that he was pretty confident he
could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was
standing on when the stone struck him.</p>
<p>All this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a
world of sad explanations, but, in the end, it proved the happy
means, as you will read, of procuring my uncle Toby his
Hobby-Horse.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXVII.</h2>
<p>There is nothing so foolish, when you are at the expence of
making an entertainment of this kind, as to order things so badly,
as to let your criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down:
Nor is there any thing so likely to make them do it, as that of
leaving them out of the party, or, what is full as offensive, of
bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so
particular a way, as if there was no such thing as a critick (by
occupation) at table.</p>
<p>&mdash;I guard against both; for, in the first place, I have
left half a dozen places purposely open for them;&mdash;and in the
next place, I pay them all court.&mdash;Gentlemen, I kiss your
hands, I protest no company could give me half the
pleasure,&mdash;by my soul I am glad to see you&mdash;I beg only
you will make no strangers of yourselves, but sit down without any
ceremony, and fall on heartily.</p>
<p>I said I had left six places, and I was upon the point of
carrying my complaisance so far, as to have left a seventh open for
them,&mdash;and in this very spot I stand on; but being told by a
Critick (tho' not by occupation,&mdash;but by nature) that I had
acquitted myself well enough, I shall fill it up directly, hoping,
in the mean time, that I shall be able to make a great deal of more
room next year.</p>
<p>&mdash;How, in the name of wonder! could your uncle Toby, who,
it seems, was a military man, and whom you have represented as no
fool,&mdash;be at the same time such a confused, pudding-headed,
muddle-headed, fellow, as&mdash;Go look.</p>
<p>So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I scorn
it.&mdash;'Tis language unurbane,&mdash;and only befitting the man
who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things, or dive
deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and confusion.
It is moreover the reply valiant&mdash;and therefore I reject it;
for tho' it might have suited my uncle Toby's character as a
soldier excellently well,&mdash;and had he not accustomed himself,
in such attacks, to whistle the Lillabullero, as he wanted no
courage, 'tis the very answer he would have given; yet it would by
no means have done for me. You see as plain as can be, that I write
as a man of erudition;&mdash;that even my similies, my allusions,
my illustrations, my metaphors, are erudite,&mdash;and that I must
sustain my character properly, and contrast it properly
too,&mdash;else what would become of me? Why, Sir, I should be
undone;&mdash;at this very moment that I am going here to fill up
one place against a critick,&mdash;I should have made an opening
for a couple.</p>
<p>&mdash;Therefore I answer thus:</p>
<p>Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you
ever read such a book as Locke's Essay upon the Human
Understanding?&mdash;Don't answer me rashly&mdash;because many, I
know, quote the book, who have not read it&mdash;and many have read
it who understand it not:&mdash;If either of these is your case, as
I write to instruct, I will tell you in three words what the book
is.&mdash;It is a history.&mdash;A history! of who? what? where?
when? Don't hurry yourself&mdash;It is a history-book, Sir, (which
may possibly recommend it to the world) of what passes in a man's
own mind; and if you will say so much of the book, and no more,
believe me, you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysick
circle.</p>
<p>But this by the way.</p>
<p>Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into
the bottom of this matter, it will be found that the cause of
obscurity and confusion, in the mind of a man, is threefold.</p>
<p>Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place. Secondly, slight and
transient impressions made by the objects, when the said organs are
not dull. And thirdly, a memory like unto a sieve, not able to
retain what it has received.&mdash;Call down Dolly your
chamber-maid, and I will give you my cap and bell along with it, if
I make not this matter so plain that Dolly herself should
understand it as well as Malbranch.&mdash;When Dolly has indited
her epistle to Robin, and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her
pocket hanging by her right side;&mdash;take that opportunity to
recollect that the organs and faculties of perception can, by
nothing in this world, be so aptly typified and explained as by
that one thing which Dolly's hand is in search of.&mdash;Your
organs are not so dull that I should inform you&mdash;'tis an inch,
Sir, of red seal-wax.</p>
<p>When this is melted and dropped upon the letter, if Dolly
fumbles too long for her thimble, till the wax is over hardened, it
will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse
which was wont to imprint it. Very well. If Dolly's wax, for want
of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper too soft,&mdash;tho' it may
receive,&mdash;it will not hold the impression, how hard soever
Dolly thrusts against it; and last of all, supposing the wax good,
and eke the thimble, but applied thereto in careless haste, as her
Mistress rings the bell;&mdash;in any one of these three cases the
print left by the thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a
brass-jack.</p>
<p>Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause
of the confusion in my uncle Toby's discourse; and it is for that
very reason I enlarge upon them so long, after the manner of great
physiologists&mdash;to shew the world, what it did not arise
from.</p>
<p>What it did arise from, I have hinted above, and a fertile
source of obscurity it is,&mdash;and ever will be,&mdash;and that
is the unsteady uses of words, which have perplexed the clearest
and most exalted understandings.</p>
<p>It is ten to one (at Arthur's) whether you have ever read the
literary histories of past ages;&mdash;if you have, what terrible
battles, 'yclept logomachies, have they occasioned and perpetuated
with so much gall and ink-shed,&mdash;that a good-natured man
cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Gentle critick! when thou hast weighed all this, and considered
within thyself how much of thy own knowledge, discourse, and
conversation has been pestered and disordered, at one time or
other, by this, and this only:&mdash;What a pudder and racket in
Councils about (Greek); and in the Schools of the learned about
power and about spirit;&mdash;about essences, and about
quintessences;&mdash;about substances, and about space.&mdash;What
confusion in greater Theatres from words of little meaning, and as
indeterminate a sense! when thou considerest this, thou wilt not
wonder at my uncle Toby's perplexities,&mdash;thou wilt drop a tear
of pity upon his scarp and his counterscarp;&mdash;his glacis and
his covered way;&mdash;his ravelin and his half-moon: 'Twas not by
ideas,&mdash;by Heaven; his life was put in jeopardy by words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXVIII.</h2>
<p>When my uncle Toby got his map of Namur to his mind, he began
immediately to apply himself, and with the utmost diligence, to the
study of it; for nothing being of more importance to him than his
recovery, and his recovery depending, as you have read, upon the
passions and affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the
nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject, as to be
able to talk upon it without emotion.</p>
<p>In a fortnight's close and painful application, which, by the
bye, did my uncle Toby's wound, upon his groin, no good,&mdash;he
was enabled, by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of
the elephant, together with Gobesius's military architecture and
pyroballogy, translated from the Flemish, to form his discourse
with passable perspicuity; and before he was two full months
gone,&mdash;he was right eloquent upon it, and could make not only
the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great order;&mdash;but
having, by that time, gone much deeper into the art, than what his
first motive made necessary, my uncle Toby was able to cross the
Maes and Sambre; make diversions as far as Vauban's line, the abbey
of Salsines, &amp;c. and give his visitors as distinct a history of
each of their attacks, as of that of the gate of St. Nicolas, where
he had the honour to receive his wound.</p>
<p>But desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases
ever with the acquisition of it. The more my uncle Toby pored over
his map, the more he took a liking to it!&mdash;by the same process
and electrical assimilation, as I told you, through which I ween
the souls of connoisseurs themselves, by long friction and
incumbition, have the happiness, at length, to get all
be-virtu'd&mdash;be-pictured,&mdash;be- butterflied, and
be-fiddled.</p>
<p>The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science,
the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so that
before the first year of his confinement had well gone round, there
was scarce a fortified town in Italy or Flanders, of which, by one
means or other, he had not procured a plan, reading over as he got
them, and carefully collating therewith the histories of their
sieges, their demolitions, their improvements, and new works, all
which he would read with that intense application and delight, that
he would forget himself, his wound, his confinement, his
dinner.</p>
<p>In the second year my uncle Toby purchased Ramelli and Cataneo,
translated from the Italian;&mdash;likewise Stevinus, Moralis, the
Chevalier de Ville, Lorini, Cochorn, Sheeter, the Count de Pagan,
the Marshal Vauban, Mons. Blondel, with almost as many more books
of military architecture, as Don Quixote was found to have of
chivalry, when the curate and barber invaded his library.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in August,
ninety-nine, my uncle Toby found it necessary to understand a
little of projectiles:&mdash;and having judged it best to draw his
knowledge from the fountain-head, he began with N. Tartaglia, who
it seems was the first man who detected the imposition of a
cannon-ball's doing all that mischief under the notion of a right
line&mdash;This N. Tartaglia proved to my uncle Toby to be an
impossible thing.</p>
<p>&mdash;Endless is the search of Truth.</p>
<p>No sooner was my uncle Toby satisfied which road the cannon-ball
did not go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved in his mind
to enquire and find out which road the ball did go: For which
purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old Maltus, and
studied him devoutly.&mdash;He proceeded next to Galileo and
Torricellius, wherein, by certain Geometrical rules, infallibly
laid down, he found the precise path to be a Parabola&mdash;or else
an Hyperbola,&mdash;and that the parameter, or latus rectum, of the
conic section of the said path, was to the quantity and amplitude
in a direct ratio, as the whole line to the sine of double the
angle of incidence, formed by the breech upon an horizontal
plane;&mdash;and that the semiparameter,&mdash;stop! my dear uncle
Toby&mdash;stop!&mdash;go not one foot farther into this thorny and
bewildered track,&mdash;intricate are the steps! intricate are the
mazes of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles which the
pursuit of this bewitching phantom Knowledge will bring upon
thee.&mdash;O my uncle;&mdash;fly&mdash;fly,&mdash;fly from it as
from a serpent.&mdash;Is it fit&mdash;goodnatured man! thou
should'st sit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights
baking thy blood with hectic watchings?&mdash;Alas! 'twill
exasperate thy symptoms,&mdash;check thy
perspirations&mdash;evaporate thy spirits&mdash;waste thy animal
strength, dry up thy radical moisture, bring thee into a costive
habit of body,&mdash;impair thy health,&mdash;and hasten all the
infirmities of thy old age.&mdash;O my uncle! my uncle Toby.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXIX.</h2>
<p>I would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft,
who does not understand this,&mdash;That the best plain narrative
in the world, tacked very close to the last spirited apostrophe to
my uncle Toby&mdash;would have felt both cold and vapid upon the
reader's palate;&mdash;therefore I forthwith put an end to the
chapter, though I was in the middle of my story.</p>
<p>&mdash;Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with
painters. Where an exact copying makes our pictures less striking,
we choose the less evil; deeming it even more pardonable to
trespass against truth, than beauty. This is to be understood cum
grano salis; but be it as it will,&mdash;as the parallel is made
more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool, than any thing
else,&mdash;'tis not very material whether upon any other score the
reader approves of it or not.</p>
<p>In the latter end of the third year, my uncle Toby perceiving
that the parameter and semi-parameter of the conic section angered
his wound, he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a
huff, and betook himself to the practical part of fortification
only; the pleasure of which, like a spring held back, returned upon
him with redoubled force.</p>
<p>It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the
daily regularity of a clean shirt,&mdash;to dismiss his barber
unshaven,&mdash;and to allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to
dress his wound, concerning himself so little about it, as not to
ask him once in seven times dressing, how it went on: when,
lo!&mdash;all of a sudden, for the change was quick as lightning,
he began to sigh heavily for his recovery,&mdash;complained to my
father, grew impatient with the surgeon:&mdash;and one morning, as
he heard his foot coming up stairs, he shut up his books, and
thrust aside his instruments, in order to expostulate with him upon
the protraction of the cure, which, he told him, might surely have
been accomplished at least by that time:&mdash;He dwelt long upon
the miseries he had undergone, and the sorrows of his four years
melancholy imprisonment;&mdash;adding, that had it not been for the
kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of
brothers,&mdash;he had long since sunk under his
misfortunes.&mdash;My father was by. My uncle Toby's eloquence
brought tears into his eyes;&mdash;'twas unexpected:&mdash;My uncle
Toby, by nature was not eloquent;&mdash;it had the greater
effect:&mdash;The surgeon was confounded;&mdash;not that there
wanted grounds for such, or greater marks of impatience,&mdash;but
'twas unexpected too; in the four years he had attended him, he had
never seen any thing like it in my uncle Toby's carriage; he had
never once dropped one fretful or discontented word;&mdash;he had
been all patience,&mdash;all submission.</p>
<p>&mdash;We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing
it;&mdash;but we often treble the force:&mdash;The surgeon was
astonished; but much more so, when he heard my uncle Toby go on,
and peremptorily insist upon his healing up the wound
directly,&mdash;or sending for Monsieur Ronjat, the king's
serjeant-surgeon, to do it for him.</p>
<p>The desire of life and health is implanted in man's
nature;&mdash;the love of liberty and enlargement is a
sister-passion to it: These my uncle Toby had in common with his
species&mdash;and either of them had been sufficient to account for
his earnest desire to get well and out of doors;&mdash;but I have
told you before, that nothing wrought with our family after the
common way;&mdash;and from the time and manner in which this eager
desire shewed itself in the present case, the penetrating reader
will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my
uncle Toby's head:&mdash;There was so, and 'tis the subject of the
next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was. I own,
when that's done, 'twill be time to return back to the parlour
fire-side, where we left my uncle Toby in the middle of his
sentence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXX.</h2>
<p>When a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling
passion,&mdash;or, in other words, when his Hobby-Horse grows
headstrong,&mdash;farewell cool reason and fair discretion!</p>
<p>My uncle Toby's wound was near well, and as soon as the surgeon
recovered his surprize, and could get leave to say as much&mdash;he
told him, 'twas just beginning to incarnate; and that if no fresh
exfoliation happened, which there was no sign of,&mdash;it would be
dried up in five or six weeks. The sound of as many Olympiads,
twelve hours before, would have conveyed an idea of shorter
duration to my uncle Toby's mind.&mdash;The succession of his ideas
was now rapid,&mdash;he broiled with impatience to put his design
in execution;&mdash;and so, without consulting farther with any
soul living,&mdash;which, by the bye, I think is right, when you
are predetermined to take no one soul's advice,&mdash;he privately
ordered Trim, his man, to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings,
and hire a chariot-and-four to be at the door exactly by twelve
o'clock that day, when he knew my father would be upon
'Change.&mdash;So leaving a bank-note upon the table for the
surgeon's care of him, and a letter of tender thanks for his
brother's&mdash;he packed up his maps, his books of fortification,
his instruments, &amp;c. and by the help of a crutch on one side,
and Trim on the other,&mdash;my uncle Toby embarked for
Shandy-Hall.</p>
<p>The reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as
follows:</p>
<p>The table in my uncle Toby's room, and at which, the night
before this change happened, he was sitting with his maps, &amp;c.
about him&mdash;being somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity
of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay
crowded upon it&mdash;he had the accident, in reaching over for his
tobacco-box, to throw down his compasses, and in stooping to take
the compasses up, with his sleeve he threw down his case of
instruments and snuffers;&mdash;and as the dice took a run against
him, in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in falling,&mdash;he
thrust Monsieur Blondel off the table, and Count de Pagon o'top of
him.</p>
<p>'Twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle Toby was, to
think of redressing these evils by himself,&mdash;he rung his bell
for his man Trim;&mdash;Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, prithee see what
confusion I have here been making&mdash;I must have some better
contrivance, Trim.&mdash;Can'st not thou take my rule, and measure
the length and breadth of this table, and then go and bespeak me
one as big again?&mdash;Yes, an' please your Honour, replied Trim,
making a bow; but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to
get down to your country-seat, where,&mdash;as your Honour takes so
much pleasure in fortification, we could manage this matter to a
T.</p>
<p>I must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle Toby's,
who went by the name of Trim, had been a corporal in my uncle's own
company,&mdash;his real name was James Butler,&mdash;but having got
the nick-name of Trim, in the regiment, my uncle Toby, unless when
he happened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any
other name.</p>
<p>The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on
his left knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of Landen, which
was two years before the affair of Namur;&mdash;and as the fellow
was well-beloved in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the
bargain, my uncle Toby took him for his servant; and of an
excellent use was he, attending my uncle Toby in the camp and in
his quarters as a valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster, and nurse;
and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with
great fidelity and affection.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby loved the man in return, and what attached him
more to him still, was the similitude of their knowledge.&mdash;For
Corporal Trim, (for so, for the future, I shall call him) by four
years occasional attention to his Master's discourse upon fortified
towns, and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his
Master's plans, &amp;c. exclusive and besides what he gained
Hobby-Horsically, as a body-servant, Non Hobby Horsical per
se;&mdash;had become no mean proficient in the science; and was
thought, by the cook and chamber-maid, to know as much of the
nature of strong-holds as my uncle Toby himself.</p>
<p>I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal Trim's
character,&mdash;and it is the only dark line in it.&mdash;The
fellow loved to advise,&mdash;or rather to hear himself talk; his
carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful, 'twas easy to keep
him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue
a-going,&mdash;you had no hold of him&mdash;he was
voluble;&mdash;the eternal interlardings of your Honour, with the
respectfulness of Corporal Trim's manner, interceding so strong in
behalf of his elocution,&mdash;that though you might have been
incommoded,&mdash;you could not well be angry. My uncle Toby was
seldom either the one or the other with him,&mdash;or, at least,
this fault, in Trim, broke no squares with them. My uncle Toby, as
I said, loved the man;&mdash;and besides, as he ever looked upon a
faithful servant,&mdash;but as an humble friend,&mdash;he could not
bear to stop his mouth.&mdash;Such was Corporal Trim.</p>
<p>If I durst presume, continued Trim, to give your Honour my
advice, and speak my opinion in this matter.&mdash;Thou art
welcome, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby&mdash;speak,&mdash;speak what
thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without fear.&mdash;Why then,
replied Trim, (not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a
country-lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead, and
standing erect as before his division,&mdash;I think, quoth Trim,
advancing his left, which was his lame leg, a little
forwards,&mdash;and pointing with his right hand open towards a map
of Dunkirk, which was pinned against the hangings,&mdash;I think,
quoth Corporal Trim, with humble submission to your Honour's better
judgment,&mdash;that these ravelins, bastions, curtins, and
hornworks, make but a poor, contemptible, fiddle-faddle piece of
work of it here upon paper, compared to what your Honour and I
could make of it were we in the country by ourselves, and had but a
rood, or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with: As
summer is coming on, continued Trim, your Honour might sit out of
doors, and give me the nography&mdash;(Call it ichnography, quoth
my uncle,)&mdash;of the town or citadel, your Honour was pleased to
sit down before,&mdash;and I will be shot by your Honour upon the
glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your Honour's
mind.&mdash;I dare say thou would'st, Trim, quoth my
uncle.&mdash;For if your Honour, continued the Corporal, could but
mark me the polygon, with its exact lines and angles&mdash;That I
could do very well, quoth my uncle.&mdash;I would begin with the
fosse, and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and
breadth&mdash;I can to a hair's breadth, Trim, replied my
uncle.&mdash;I would throw out the earth upon this hand towards the
town for the scarp,&mdash;and on that hand towards the campaign for
the counterscarp.&mdash;Very right, Trim, quoth my uncle
Toby:&mdash;And when I had sloped them to your mind,&mdash;an'
please your Honour, I would face the glacis, as the finest
fortifications are done in Flanders, with sods,&mdash;and as your
Honour knows they should be,&mdash;and I would make the walls and
parapets with sods too.&mdash;The best engineers call them gazons,
Trim, said my uncle Toby.&mdash;Whether they are gazons or sods, is
not much matter, replied Trim; your Honour knows they are ten times
beyond a facing either of brick or stone.&mdash;I know they are,
Trim in some respects,&mdash;quoth my uncle Toby, nodding his
head;&mdash;for a cannon-ball enters into the gazon right onwards,
without bringing any rubbish down with it, which might fill the
fosse, (as was the case at St. Nicolas's gate) and facilitate the
passage over it.</p>
<p>Your Honour understands these matters, replied Corporal Trim,
better than any officer in his Majesty's service;&mdash;but would
your Honour please to let the bespeaking of the table alone, and
let us but go into the country, I would work under your Honour's
directions like a horse, and make fortifications for you something
like a tansy, with all their batteries, saps, ditches, and
palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world's riding twenty
miles to go and see it.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby blushed as red as scarlet as Trim went
on;&mdash;but it was not a blush of guilt,&mdash;of
modesty,&mdash;or of anger,&mdash;it was a blush of joy;&mdash;he
was fired with Corporal Trim's project and description.&mdash;Trim!
said my uncle Toby, thou hast said enough.&mdash;We might begin the
campaign, continued Trim, on the very day that his Majesty and the
Allies take the field, and demolish them town by town as fast
as&mdash;Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, say no more. Your Honour,
continued Trim, might sit in your arm-chair (pointing to it) this
fine weather, giving me your orders, and I would&mdash;Say no more,
Trim, quoth my uncle Toby&mdash;Besides, your Honour would get not
only pleasure and good pastime&mdash;but good air, and good
exercise, and good health,&mdash;and your Honour's wound would be
well in a month. Thou hast said enough, Trim,&mdash;quoth my uncle
Toby (putting his hand into his breeches-pocket)&mdash;I like thy
project mightily.&mdash;And if your Honour pleases, I'll this
moment go and buy a pioneer's spade to take down with us, and I'll
bespeak a shovel and a pick-axe, and a couple of&mdash;Say no more,
Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, leaping up upon one leg, quite overcome
with rapture,&mdash;and thrusting a guinea into Trim's
hand,&mdash;Trim, said my uncle Toby, say no more;&mdash;but go
down, Trim, this moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this
instant.</p>
<p>Trim ran down and brought up his master's supper,&mdash;to no
purpose:&mdash;Trim's plan of operation ran so in my uncle Toby's
head, he could not taste it.&mdash;Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, get
me to bed.&mdash;'Twas all one.&mdash;Corporal Trim's description
had fired his imagination,&mdash;my uncle Toby could not shut his
eyes.&mdash;The more he considered it, the more bewitching the
scene appeared to him;&mdash;so that, two full hours before
day-light, he had come to a final determination and had concerted
the whole plan of his and Corporal Trim's decampment.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby had a little neat country-house of his own, in the
village where my father's estate lay at Shandy, which had been left
him by an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred
pounds a-year. Behind this house, and contiguous to it, was a
kitchen-garden of about half an acre, and at the bottom of the
garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge, was a
bowling-green, containing just about as much ground as Corporal
Trim wished for;&mdash;so that as Trim uttered the words, 'A rood
and a half of ground to do what they would with,'&mdash;this
identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and became
curiously painted all at once, upon the retina of my uncle Toby's
fancy;&mdash;which was the physical cause of making him change
colour, or at least of heightening his blush, to that immoderate
degree I spoke of.</p>
<p>Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat
and expectation, than my uncle Toby did, to enjoy this self-same
thing in private;&mdash;I say in private;&mdash;for it was
sheltered from the house, as I told you, by a tall yew hedge, and
was covered on the other three sides, from mortal sight, by rough
holly and thick-set flowering shrubs:&mdash;so that the idea of not
being seen, did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure
pre-conceived in my uncle Toby's mind.&mdash;Vain thought! however
thick it was planted about,&mdash;or private soever it might
seem,&mdash;to think, dear uncle Toby, of enjoying a thing which
took up a whole rood and a half of ground,&mdash;and not have it
known!</p>
<p>How my uncle Toby and Corporal Trim managed this
matter,&mdash;with the history of their campaigns, which were no
way barren of events,&mdash;may make no uninteresting under-plot in
the epitasis and working-up of this drama.&mdash;At present the
scene must drop,&mdash;and change for the parlour fire-side.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXI.</h2>
<p>&mdash;What can they be doing? brother, said my father.&mdash;I
think, replied my uncle Toby,&mdash;taking, as I told you, his pipe
from his mouth, and striking the ashes out of it as he began his
sentence;&mdash;I think, replied he,&mdash;it would not be amiss,
brother, if we rung the bell.</p>
<p>Pray, what's all that racket over our heads,
Obadiah?&mdash;quoth my father;&mdash;my brother and I can scarce
hear ourselves speak.</p>
<p>Sir, answered Obadiah, making a bow towards his left
shoulder,&mdash;my Mistress is taken very badly.&mdash;And where's
Susannah running down the garden there, as if they were going to
ravish her?&mdash;Sir, she is running the shortest cut into the
town, replied Obadiah, to fetch the old midwife.&mdash;Then saddle
a horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly for Dr. Slop, the
man-midwife, with all our services,&mdash;and let him know your
mistress is fallen into labour&mdash;and that I desire he will
return with you with all speed.</p>
<p>It is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my
uncle Toby, as Obadiah shut the door,&mdash;as there is so expert
an operator as Dr. Slop so near,&mdash;that my wife should persist
to the very last in this obstinate humour of hers, in trusting the
life of my child, who has had one misfortune already, to the
ignorance of an old woman;&mdash;and not only the life of my child,
brother,&mdash;but her own life, and with it the lives of all the
children I might, peradventure, have begot out of her
hereafter.</p>
<p>Mayhap, brother, replied my uncle Toby, my sister does it to
save the expence:&mdash;A pudding's end,&mdash;replied my
father,&mdash;the Doctor must be paid the same for inaction as
action,&mdash;if not better,&mdash;to keep him in temper.</p>
<p>&mdash;Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world, quoth
my uncle Toby, in the simplicity of his heart,&mdash;but
Modesty.&mdash;My sister, I dare say, added he, does not care to
let a man come so near her.... I will not say whether my uncle Toby
had completed the sentence or not;&mdash;'tis for his advantage to
suppose he had,&mdash;as, I think, he could have added no One Word
which would have improved it.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, my uncle Toby had not fully arrived at the
period's end&mdash;then the world stands indebted to the sudden
snapping of my father's tobacco-pipe for one of the neatest
examples of that ornamental figure in oratory, which Rhetoricians
stile the Aposiopesis.&mdash;Just Heaven! how does the Poco piu and
the Poco meno of the Italian artists;&mdash;the insensible more or
less, determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence, as well
as in the statue! How do the slight touches of the chisel, the
pencil, the pen, the fiddle-stick, et caetera,&mdash;give the true
swell, which gives the true pleasure!&mdash;O my
countrymen:&mdash;be nice; be cautious of your language; and never,
O! never let it be forgotten upon what small particles your
eloquence and your fame depend.</p>
<p>&mdash;'My sister, mayhap,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'does not
choose to let a man come so near her....' Make this
dash,&mdash;'tis an Aposiopesis,&mdash;Take the dash away, and
write Backside,&mdash;'tis Bawdy.&mdash;Scratch Backside out, and
put Cover'd way in, 'tis a Metaphor;&mdash;and, I dare say, as
fortification ran so much in my uncle Toby's head, that if he had
been left to have added one word to the sentence,&mdash;that word
was it.</p>
<p>But whether that was the case or not the case;&mdash;or whether
the snapping of my father's tobacco-pipe, so critically, happened
through accident or anger, will be seen in due time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXII.</h2>
<p>Tho' my father was a good natural philosopher,&mdash;yet he was
something of a moral philosopher too; for which reason, when his
tobacco-pipe snapp'd short in the middle,&mdash;he had nothing to
do, as such, but to have taken hold of the two pieces, and thrown
them gently upon the back of the fire.&mdash;He did no such
thing;&mdash;he threw them with all the violence in the
world;&mdash;and, to give the action still more emphasis,&mdash;he
started upon both his legs to do it.</p>
<p>This looked something like heat;&mdash;and the manner of his
reply to what my uncle Toby was saying, proved it was so.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Not choose,' quoth my father, (repeating my uncle Toby's
words) 'to let a man come so near her!'&mdash;By Heaven, brother
Toby! you would try the patience of Job;&mdash;and I think I have
the plagues of one already without
it.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Where?&mdash;Wherein?&mdash;Wherefore?&mdash;Upon
what account? replied my uncle Toby: in the utmost
astonishment.&mdash;To think, said my father, of a man living to
your age, brother, and knowing so little about women!&mdash;I know
nothing at all about them,&mdash;replied my uncle Toby: And I
think, continued he, that the shock I received the year after the
demolition of Dunkirk, in my affair with widow Wadman;&mdash;which
shock you know I should not have received, but from my total
ignorance of the sex,&mdash;has given me just cause to say, That I
neither know nor do pretend to know any thing about 'em or their
concerns either.&mdash;Methinks, brother, replied my father, you
might, at least, know so much as the right end of a woman from the
wrong.</p>
<p>It is said in Aristotle's Master Piece, 'That when a man doth
think of any thing which is past,&mdash;he looketh down upon the
ground;&mdash;but that when he thinketh of something that is to
come, he looketh up towards the heavens.'</p>
<p>My uncle Toby, I suppose, thought of neither, for he look'd
horizontally.&mdash;Right end! quoth my uncle Toby, muttering the
two words low to himself, and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he
muttered them, upon a small crevice, formed by a bad joint in the
chimney-piece&mdash;Right end of a woman!&mdash;I declare, quoth my
uncle, I know no more which it is than the man in the
moon;&mdash;and if I was to think, continued my uncle Toby (keeping
his eyes still fixed upon the bad joint) this month together, I am
sure I should not be able to find it out.</p>
<p>Then, brother Toby, replied my father, I will tell you.</p>
<p>Every thing in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh
pipe)&mdash;every thing in this world, my dear brother Toby, has
two handles.&mdash;Not always, quoth my uncle Toby.&mdash;At least,
replied my father, every one has two hands,&mdash;which comes to
the same thing.&mdash;Now, if a man was to sit down coolly, and
consider within himself the make, the shape, the construction,
come-at-ability, and convenience of all the parts which constitute
the whole of that animal, called Woman, and compare them
analogically&mdash;I never understood rightly the meaning of that
word,&mdash;quoth my uncle Toby.&mdash;</p>
<p>Analogy, replied my father, is the certain relation and
agreement which different&mdash;Here a devil of a rap at the door
snapped my father's definition (like his tobacco-pipe) in
two,&mdash;and, at the same time, crushed the head of as notable
and curious a dissertation as ever was engendered in the womb of
speculation;&mdash;it was some months before my father could get an
opportunity to be safely delivered of it:&mdash;And, at this hour,
it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the
dissertation itself,&mdash;(considering the confusion and
distresses of our domestick misadventures, which are now coming
thick one upon the back of another) whether I shall be able to find
a place for it in the third volume or not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXIII.</h2>
<p>It is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my
uncle Toby rung the bell, when Obadiah was ordered to saddle a
horse, and go for Dr. Slop, the man-midwife;&mdash;so that no one
can say, with reason, that I have not allowed Obadiah time enough,
poetically speaking, and considering the emergency too, both to go
and come;&mdash;though, morally and truly speaking, the man perhaps
has scarce had time to get on his boots.</p>
<p>If the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all
to take a pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the
ringing of the bell, and the rap at the door;&mdash;and, after
finding it to be no more than two minutes, thirteen seconds, and
three-fifths,&mdash;should take upon him to insult over me for such
a breach in the unity, or rather probability of time;&mdash;I would
remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its simple modes, is
got merely from the train and succession of our ideas&mdash;and is
the true scholastic pendulum,&mdash;and by which, as a scholar, I
will be tried in this matter,&mdash;abjuring and detesting the
jurisdiction of all other pendulums whatever.</p>
<p>I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor
eight miles from Shandy-Hall to Dr. Slop, the man-midwife's
house:&mdash;and that whilst Obadiah has been going those said
miles and back, I have brought my uncle Toby from Namur, quite
across all Flanders, into England:&mdash;That I have had him ill
upon my hands near four years;&mdash;and have since travelled him
and Corporal Trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near two
hundred miles down into Yorkshire.&mdash;all which put together,
must have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of Dr.
Slop upon the stage,&mdash;as much, at least (I hope) as a dance, a
song, or a concerto between the acts.</p>
<p>If my hypercritick is intractable, alledging, that two minutes
and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen
seconds,&mdash;when I have said all I can about them; and that this
plea, though it might save me dramatically, will damn me
biographically, rendering my book from this very moment, a
professed Romance, which, before, was a book apocryphal:&mdash;If I
am thus pressed&mdash;I then put an end to the whole objection and
controversy about it all at once,&mdash;by acquainting him, that
Obadiah had not got above threescore yards from the stable-yard,
before he met with Dr. Slop;&mdash;and indeed he gave a dirty proof
that he had met with him, and was within an ace of giving a
tragical one too.</p>
<p>Imagine to yourself;&mdash;but this had better begin a new
chapter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXIV.</h2>
<p>Imagine to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure of a Doctor
Slop, of about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a
breadth of back, and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have
done honour to a serjeant in the horse-guards.</p>
<p>Such were the out-lines of Dr. Slop's figure, which&mdash;if you
have read Hogarth's analysis of beauty, and if you have not, I wish
you would;&mdash;you must know, may as certainly be caricatured,
and conveyed to the mind by three strokes as three hundred.</p>
<p>Imagine such a one,&mdash;for such, I say, were the outlines of
Dr. Slop's figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling
thro' the dirt upon the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony, of a
pretty colour&mdash;but of strength,&mdash;alack!&mdash;scarce able
to have made an amble of it, under such a fardel, had the roads
been in an ambling condition.&mdash;They were not.&mdash;Imagine to
yourself, Obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of a coach-horse,
pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable speed the
adverse way.</p>
<p>Pray, Sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.</p>
<p>Had Dr. Slop beheld Obadiah a mile off, posting in a narrow lane
directly towards him, at that monstrous rate,&mdash;splashing and
plunging like a devil thro' thick and thin, as he approached, would
not such a phaenomenon, with such a vortex of mud and water moving
along with it, round its axis,&mdash;have been a subject of juster
apprehension to Dr. Slop in his situation, than the worst of
Whiston's comets?&mdash;To say nothing of the Nucleus; that is, of
Obadiah and the coach-horse.&mdash;In my idea, the vortex alone of
'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at
least the doctor's pony, quite away with it. What then do you think
must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr. Slop have been, when you
read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus
warily along towards Shandy-Hall, and had approached to within
sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by
an acute angle of the garden-wall,&mdash;and in the dirtiest part
of a dirty lane,&mdash;when Obadiah and his coach-horse turned the
corner, rapid, furious,&mdash;pop,&mdash;full upon
him!&mdash;Nothing, I think, in nature, can be supposed more
terrible than such a rencounter,&mdash;so imprompt! so ill prepared
to stand the shock of it as Dr. Slop was.</p>
<p>What could Dr. Slop do?&mdash;he crossed himself +
&mdash;Pugh!&mdash;but the doctor, Sir, was a Papist.&mdash;No
matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel.&mdash;He had
so;&mdash;nay, as it happened, he had better have done nothing at
all; for in crossing himself he let go his whip,&mdash;and in
attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle's
skirt, as it slipped, he lost his stirrup,&mdash;in losing which he
lost his seat;&mdash;and in the multitude of all these losses
(which, by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in
crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind. So that
without waiting for Obadiah's onset, he left his pony to its
destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the stile and
manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence from
the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been) with the
broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire.</p>
<p>Obadiah pull'd off his cap twice to Dr. Slop;&mdash;once as he
was falling,&mdash;and then again when he saw him
seated.&mdash;Ill-timed complaisance;&mdash;had not the fellow
better have stopped his horse, and got off and help'd
him?&mdash;Sir, he did all that his situation would
allow;&mdash;but the Momentum of the coach-horse was so great, that
Obadiah could not do it all at once; he rode in a circle three
times round Dr. Slop, before he could fully accomplish it any
how;&mdash;and at the last, when he did stop his beast, 'twas done
with such an explosion of mud, that Obadiah had better have been a
league off. In short, never was a Dr. Slop so beluted, and so
transubstantiated, since that affair came into fashion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXV.</h2>
<p>When Dr. Slop entered the back parlour, where my father and my
uncle Toby were discoursing upon the nature of women,&mdash;it was
hard to determine whether Dr. Slop's figure, or Dr. Slop's
presence, occasioned more surprize to them; for as the accident
happened so near the house, as not to make it worth while for
Obadiah to remount him,&mdash;Obadiah had led him in as he was,
unwiped, unappointed, unannealed, with all his stains and blotches
on him.&mdash;He stood like Hamlet's ghost, motionless and
speechless, for a full minute and a half at the parlour-door
(Obadiah still holding his hand) with all the majesty of mud. His
hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall, totally
besmeared,&mdash;and in every other part of him, blotched over in
such a manner with Obadiah's explosion, that you would have sworn
(without mental reservation) that every grain of it had taken
effect.</p>
<p>Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumphed
over my father in his turn;&mdash;for no mortal, who had beheld Dr.
Slop in that pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least,
of my uncle Toby's opinion, 'That mayhap his sister might not care
to let such a Dr. Slop come so near her....' But it was the
Argumentum ad hominem; and if my uncle Toby was not very expert at
it, you may think, he might not care to use it.&mdash;No; the
reason was,&mdash;'twas not his nature to insult.</p>
<p>Dr. Slop's presence at that time, was no less problematical than
the mode of it; tho' it is certain, one moment's reflexion in my
father might have solved it; for he had apprized Dr. Slop but the
week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the
doctor had heard nothing since, 'twas natural and very political
too in him, to have taken a ride to Shandy-Hall, as he did, merely
to see how matters went on.</p>
<p>But my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the
investigation; running, like the hypercritick's, altogether upon
the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door,&mdash;measuring
their distance, and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation,
as to have power to think of nothing else,&mdash;common-place
infirmity of the greatest mathematicians! working with might and
main at the demonstration, and so wasting all their strength upon
it, that they have none left in them to draw the corollary, to do
good with.</p>
<p>The ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck
likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle Toby,&mdash;but it
excited a very different train of thoughts;&mdash;the two
irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought Stevinus, the great
engineer, along with them, into my uncle Toby's mind. What business
Stevinus had in this affair,&mdash;is the greatest problem of
all:&mdash;It shall be solved,&mdash;but not in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>Writing, when properly managed (as you may be sure I think mine
is) is but a different name for conversation. As no one, who knows
what he is about in good company, would venture to talk
all;&mdash;so no author, who understands the just boundaries of
decorum and good-breeding, would presume to think all: The truest
respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding, is to
halve this matter amicably, and leave him something to imagine, in
his turn, as well as yourself.</p>
<p>For my own part, I am eternally paying him compliments of this
kind, and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as
busy as my own.</p>
<p>'Tis his turn now;&mdash;I have given an ample description of
Dr. Slop's sad overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the
back-parlour;&mdash;his imagination must now go on with it for a
while.</p>
<p>Let the reader imagine then, that Dr. Slop has told his
tale&mdash;and in what words, and with what aggravations, his fancy
chooses;&mdash;Let him suppose, that Obadiah has told his tale
also, and with such rueful looks of affected concern, as he thinks
best will contrast the two figures as they stand by each
other.&mdash;Let him imagine, that my father has stepped up stairs
to see my mother.&mdash;And, to conclude this work of
imagination,&mdash;let him imagine the doctor washed,&mdash;rubbed
down, and condoled,&mdash;felicitated,&mdash;got into a pair of
Obadiah's pumps, stepping forwards towards the door, upon the very
point of entering upon action.</p>
<p>Truce!&mdash;truce, good Dr. Slop!&mdash;stay thy obstetrick
hand;&mdash;return it safe into thy bosom to keep it
warm;&mdash;little dost thou know what obstacles,&mdash;little dost
thou think what hidden causes, retard its operation!&mdash;Hast
thou, Dr. Slop,&mdash;hast thou been entrusted with the secret
articles of the solemn treaty which has brought thee into this
place?&mdash;Art thou aware that at this instant, a daughter of
Lucina is put obstetrically over thy head? Alas!&mdash;'tis too
true.&mdash;Besides, great son of Pilumnus! what canst thou
do?&mdash;Thou hast come forth unarm'd;&mdash;thou hast left thy
tire-tete,&mdash;thy new-invented forceps,&mdash;thy
crotchet,&mdash;thy squirt, and all thy instruments of salvation
and deliverance, behind thee,&mdash;By Heaven! at this moment they
are hanging up in a green bays bag, betwixt thy two pistols, at the
bed's head!&mdash;Ring;&mdash;call;&mdash;send Obadiah back upon
the coach-horse to bring them with all speed.</p>
<p>&mdash;Make great haste, Obadiah, quoth my father, and I'll give
thee a crown! and quoth my uncle Toby, I'll give him another.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXVII.</h2>
<p>Your sudden and unexpected arrival, quoth my uncle Toby,
addressing himself to Dr. Slop, (all three of them sitting down to
the fire together, as my uncle Toby began to speak)&mdash;instantly
brought the great Stevinus into my head, who, you must know, is a
favourite author with me.&mdash;Then, added my father, making use
of the argument Ad Crumenam,&mdash;I will lay twenty guineas to a
single crown-piece (which will serve to give away to Obadiah when
he gets back) that this same Stevinus was some engineer or
other&mdash;or has wrote something or other, either directly or
indirectly, upon the science of fortification.</p>
<p>He has so,&mdash;replied my uncle Toby.&mdash;I knew it, said my
father, though, for the soul of me, I cannot see what kind of
connection there can be betwixt Dr. Slop's sudden coming, and a
discourse upon fortification;&mdash;yet I fear'd it.&mdash;Talk of
what we will, brother,&mdash;or let the occasion be never so
foreign or unfit for the subject,&mdash;you are sure to bring it
in. I would not, brother Toby, continued my father,&mdash;I declare
I would not have my head so full of curtins and
horn-works.&mdash;That I dare say you would not, quoth Dr. Slop,
interrupting him, and laughing most immoderately at his pun.</p>
<p>Dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the
insinuation of a pun, more cordially than my father;&mdash;he would
grow testy upon it at any time;&mdash;but to be broke in upon by
one, in a serious discourse, was as bad, he would say, as a fillip
upon the nose;&mdash;he saw no difference.</p>
<p>Sir, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Dr.
Slop,&mdash;the curtins my brother Shandy mentions here, have
nothing to do with beadsteads;&mdash;tho', I know Du Cange says,
'That bed-curtains, in all probability, have taken their name from
them;'&mdash;nor have the horn-works he speaks of, any thing in the
world to do with the horn-works of cuckoldom: But the Curtin, Sir,
is the word we use in fortification, for that part of the wall or
rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins
them&mdash;Besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks
directly against the curtin, for this reason, because they are so
well flanked. ('Tis the case of other curtains, quoth Dr. Slop,
laughing.) However, continued my uncle Toby, to make them sure, we
generally choose to place ravelins before them, taking care only to
extend them beyond the fosse or ditch:&mdash;The common men, who
know very little of fortification, confound the ravelin and the
half-moon together,&mdash;tho' they are very different
things;&mdash;not in their figure or construction, for we make them
exactly alike, in all points; for they always consist of two faces,
making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in form
of a crescent;&mdash;Where then lies the difference? (quoth my
father, a little testily.)&mdash;In their situations, answered my
uncle Toby:&mdash;For when a ravelin, brother, stands before the
curtin, it is a ravelin; and when a ravelin stands before a
bastion, then the ravelin is not a ravelin;&mdash;it is a
half-moon;&mdash;a half-moon likewise is a half-moon, and no more,
so long as it stands before its bastion;&mdash;but was it to change
place, and get before the curtin,&mdash;'twould be no longer a
half-moon; a half-moon, in that case, is not a
half-moon;&mdash;'tis no more than a ravelin.&mdash;I think, quoth
my father, that the noble science of defence has its weak
sides&mdash;as well as others.</p>
<p>As for the horn-work (high! ho! sigh'd my father) which,
continued my uncle Toby, my brother was speaking of, they are a
very considerable part of an outwork;&mdash;they are called by the
French engineers, Ouvrage a corne, and we generally make them to
cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the
rest;&mdash;'tis formed by two epaulments or
demi-bastions&mdash;they are very pretty,&mdash;and if you will
take a walk, I'll engage to shew you one well worth your
trouble.&mdash;I own, continued my uncle Toby, when we crown
them,&mdash;they are much stronger, but then they are very
expensive, and take up a great deal of ground, so that, in my
opinion, they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a
camp; otherwise the double tenaille&mdash;By the mother who bore
us!&mdash;brother Toby, quoth my father, not able to hold out any
longer,&mdash;you would provoke a saint;&mdash;here have you got
us, I know not how, not only souse into the middle of the old
subject again:&mdash;But so full is your head of these confounded
works, that though my wife is this moment in the pains of labour,
and you hear her cry out, yet nothing will serve you but to carry
off the man-midwife.&mdash;Accoucheur,&mdash;if you please, quoth
Dr. Slop.&mdash;With all my heart, replied my father, I don't care
what they call you,&mdash;but I wish the whole science of
fortification, with all its inventors, at the devil;&mdash;it has
been the death of thousands,&mdash;and it will be mine in the
end.&mdash;I would not, I would not, brother Toby, have my brains
so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, pallisadoes, ravelins,
half-moons, and such trumpery, to be proprietor of Namur, and of
all the towns in Flanders with it.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby was a man patient of injuries;&mdash;not from want
of courage,&mdash;I have told you in a former chapter, 'that he was
a man of courage:'&mdash;And will add here, that where just
occasions presented, or called it forth,&mdash;I know no man under
whose arm I would have sooner taken shelter;&mdash;nor did this
arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual
parts;&mdash;for he felt this insult of my father's as feelingly as
a man could do;&mdash;but he was of a peaceful, placid
nature,&mdash;no jarring element in it,&mdash;all was mixed up so
kindly within him; my uncle Toby had scarce a heart to retaliate
upon a fly.</p>
<p>&mdash;Go&mdash;says he, one day at dinner, to an over-grown one
which had buzzed about his nose, and tormented him cruelly all
dinner-time,&mdash;and which after infinite attempts, he had caught
at last, as it flew by him;&mdash;I'll not hurt thee, says my uncle
Toby, rising from his chair, and going across the room, with the
fly in his hand,&mdash;I'll not hurt a hair of thy head:&mdash;Go,
says he, lifting up the sash, and opening his hand as he spoke, to
let it escape;&mdash;go, poor devil, get thee gone, why should I
hurt thee?&mdash;This world surely is wide enough to hold both thee
and me.</p>
<p>I was but ten years old when this happened: but whether it was,
that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age
of pity, which instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of
most pleasurable sensation;&mdash;or how far the manner and
expression of it might go towards it;&mdash;or in what degree, or
by what secret magick,&mdash;a tone of voice and harmony of
movement, attuned by mercy, might find a passage to my heart, I
know not;&mdash;this I know, that the lesson of universal good-will
then taught and imprinted by my uncle Toby, has never since been
worn out of my mind: And tho' I would not depreciate what the study
of the Literae humaniores, at the university, have done for me in
that respect, or discredit the other helps of an expensive
education bestowed upon me, both at home and abroad
since;&mdash;yet I often think that I owe one half of my
philanthropy to that one accidental impression.</p>
<p>This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole
volume upon the subject.</p>
<p>I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle Toby's
picture, by the instrument with which I drew the other parts of
it,&mdash;that taking in no more than the mere Hobby-Horsical
likeness:&mdash;this is a part of his moral character. My father,
in this patient endurance of wrongs, which I mention, was very
different, as the reader must long ago have noted; he had a much
more acute and quick sensibility of nature, attended with a little
soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing
which looked like malignancy:&mdash;yet in the little rubs and
vexations of life, 'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty
kind of peevishness:&mdash;He was, however, frank and generous in
his nature;&mdash;at all times open to conviction; and in the
little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards others, but
particularly towards my uncle Toby, whom he truly loved:&mdash;he
would feel more pain, ten times told (except in the affair of my
aunt Dinah, or where an hypothesis was concerned) than what he ever
gave.</p>
<p>The characters of the two brothers, in this view of them,
reflected light upon each other, and appeared with great advantage
in this affair which arose about Stevinus.</p>
<p>I need not tell the reader, if he keeps a
Hobby-Horse,&mdash;that a man's Hobby-Horse is as tender a part as
he has about him; and that these unprovoked strokes at my uncle
Toby's could not be unfelt by him.&mdash;No:&mdash;as I said above,
my uncle Toby did feel them, and very sensibly too.</p>
<p>Pray, Sir, what said he?&mdash;How did he behave?&mdash;O,
Sir!&mdash;it was great: For as soon as my father had done
insulting his Hobby-Horse,&mdash;he turned his head without the
least emotion, from Dr. Slop, to whom he was addressing his
discourse, and looking up into my father's face, with a countenance
spread over with so much good-nature;&mdash;so placid;&mdash;so
fraternal;&mdash;so inexpressibly tender towards him:&mdash;it
penetrated my father to his heart: He rose up hastily from his
chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle Toby's hands as he
spoke:&mdash;Brother Toby, said he:&mdash;I beg thy
pardon;&mdash;forgive, I pray thee, this rash humour which my
mother gave me.&mdash;My dear, dear brother, answered my uncle
Toby, rising up by my father's help, say no more about
it;&mdash;you are heartily welcome, had it been ten times as much,
brother. But 'tis ungenerous, replied my father, to hurt any
man;&mdash;a brother worse;&mdash;but to hurt a brother of such
gentle manners,&mdash;so unprovoking,&mdash;and so
unresenting;&mdash;'tis base:&mdash;By Heaven, 'tis
cowardly.&mdash;You are heartily welcome, brother, quoth my uncle
Toby,&mdash;had it been fifty times as much.&mdash;Besides, what
have I to do, my dear Toby, cried my father, either with your
amusements or your pleasures, unless it was in my power (which it
is not) to increase their measure?</p>
<p>&mdash;Brother Shandy, answered my uncle Toby, looking wistfully
in his face,&mdash;you are much mistaken in this point:&mdash;for
you do increase my pleasure very much, in begetting children for
the Shandy family at your time of life.&mdash;But, by that, Sir,
quoth Dr. Slop, Mr. Shandy increases his own.&mdash;Not a jot,
quoth my father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XXXIX.</h2>
<p>At the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle Toby were
left both standing, like Brutus and Cassius, at the close of the
scene, making up their accounts.</p>
<p>As my father spoke the three last words,&mdash;he sat
down;&mdash;my uncle Toby exactly followed his example, only, that
before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order Corporal Trim,
who was in waiting, to step home for Stevinus:&mdash;my uncle
Toby's house being no farther off than the opposite side of the
way.</p>
<p>Some men would have dropped the subject of Stevinus;&mdash;but
my uncle Toby had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with
the subject, to shew my father that he had none.</p>
<p>Your sudden appearance, Dr. Slop, quoth my uncle, resuming the
discourse, instantly brought Stevinus into my head. (My father, you
may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon Stevinus's
head.)&mdash;Because, continued my uncle Toby, the celebrated
sailing chariot, which belonged to Prince Maurice, and was of such
wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people
thirty German miles, in I don't know how few minutes,&mdash;was
invented by Stevinus, that great mathematician and engineer.</p>
<p>You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr. Slop
(as the fellow is lame) of going for Stevinus's account of it,
because in my return from Leyden thro' the Hague, I walked as far
as Schevling, which is two long miles, on purpose to take a view of
it.</p>
<p>That's nothing, replied my uncle Toby, to what the learned
Peireskius did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles,
reckoning from Paris to Schevling, and from Schevling to Paris back
again, in order to see it, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.</p>
<p>The more fool Peireskius, replied Dr. Slop. But mark, 'twas out
of no contempt of Peireskius at all;&mdash;but that Peireskius's
indefatigable labour in trudging so far on foot, out of love for
the sciences, reduced the exploit of Dr. Slop, in that affair, to
nothing:&mdash;the more fool Peireskius, said he again.&mdash;Why
so?&mdash;replied my father, taking his brother's part, not only to
make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given
him, which sat still upon my father's mind;&mdash;but partly, that
my father began really to interest himself in the
discourse.&mdash;Why so?&mdash;said he. Why is Peireskius, or any
man else, to be abused for an appetite for that, or any other
morsel of sound knowledge: For notwithstanding I know nothing of
the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have
had a very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon what
principles of philosophy he has atchieved it;&mdash;yet certainly
his machine has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they
will, or it could not have answered at the rate my brother
mentions.</p>
<p>It answered, replied my uncle Toby, as well, if not better; for,
as Peireskius elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of
its motion, Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus; which, unless I have
forgot my Latin, is, that it was as swift as the wind itself.</p>
<p>But pray, Dr. Slop, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho'
not without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what
principles was this self-same chariot set a-going?&mdash;Upon very
pretty principles to be sure, replied Dr. Slop:&mdash;And I have
often wondered, continued he, evading the question, why none of our
gentry, who live upon large plains like this of
ours,&mdash;(especially they whose wives are not past
child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only
be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is
subject,&mdash;if the wind only served,&mdash;but would be
excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost
nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the
devil take 'em) both cost and eat a great deal.</p>
<p>For that very reason, replied my father, 'Because they cost
nothing, and because they eat nothing,'&mdash;the scheme is
bad;&mdash;it is the consumption of our products, as well as the
manufactures of them, which gives bread to the hungry, circulates
trade,&mdash;brings in money, and supports the value of our
lands;&mdash;and tho', I own, if I was a Prince, I would generously
recompense the scientifick head which brought forth such
contrivances;&mdash;yet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of
them.</p>
<p>My father here had got into his element,&mdash;and was going on
as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle Toby
had before, upon his of fortification;&mdash;but to the loss of
much sound knowledge, the destinies in the morning had decreed that
no dissertation of any kind should be spun by my father that
day,&mdash;for as he opened his mouth to begin the next
sentence,</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XL.</h2>
<p>In popped Corporal Trim with Stevinus:&mdash;But 'twas too
late,&mdash;all the discourse had been exhausted without him, and
was running into a new channel.</p>
<p>&mdash;You may take the book home again, Trim, said my uncle
Toby, nodding to him.</p>
<p>But prithee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,&mdash;look
first into it, and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot
in it.</p>
<p>Corporal Trim, by being in the service, had learned to
obey,&mdash;and not to remonstrate,&mdash;so taking the book to a
side-table, and running over the leaves; An' please your Honour,
said Trim, I can see no such thing;&mdash;however, continued the
Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I'll make sure work of it,
an' please your Honour;&mdash;so taking hold of the two covers of
the book, one in each hand, and letting the leaves fall down as he
bent the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.</p>
<p>There is something falling out, however, said Trim, an' please
your Honour;&mdash;but it is not a chariot, or any thing like
one:&mdash;Prithee, Corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it
then?&mdash;I think, answered Trim, stooping to take it
up,&mdash;'tis more like a sermon,&mdash;for it begins with a text
of scripture, and the chapter and verse;&mdash;and then goes on,
not as a chariot, but like a sermon directly.</p>
<p>The company smiled.</p>
<p>I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle Toby, for
such a thing as a sermon to have got into my Stevinus.</p>
<p>I think 'tis a sermon, replied Trim:&mdash;but if it please your
Honours, as it is a fair hand, I will read you a page;&mdash;for
Trim, you must know, loved to hear himself read almost as well as
talk.</p>
<p>I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into
things which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as
these;&mdash;and as we have nothing better to do, at least till
Obadiah gets back, I shall be obliged to you, brother, if Dr. Slop
has no objection to it, to order the Corporal to give us a page or
two of it,&mdash;if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing.
An' please your honour, quoth Trim, I officiated two whole
campaigns, in Flanders, as clerk to the chaplain of the
regiment.&mdash;He can read it, quoth my uncle Toby, as well as I
can.&mdash;Trim, I assure you, was the best scholar in my company,
and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's
misfortune. Corporal Trim laid his hand upon his heart, and made an
humble bow to his master; then laying down his hat upon the floor,
and taking up the sermon in his left hand, in order to have his
right at liberty,&mdash;he advanced, nothing doubting, into the
middle of the room, where he could best see, and be best seen by
his audience.</p>

<p>&mdash;If you have any objection,&mdash;said my father,
addressing himself to Dr. Slop. Not in the least, replied Dr.
Slop;&mdash;for it does not appear on which side of the question it
is wrote,&mdash;it may be a composition of a divine of our church,
as well as yours,&mdash;so that we run equal risques.&mdash;'Tis
wrote upon neither side, quoth Trim, for 'tis only upon Conscience,
an' please your Honours.</p>
<p>Trim's reason put his audience into good humour,&mdash;all but
Dr. Slop, who turning his head about towards Trim, looked a little
angry.</p>
<p>Begin, Trim,&mdash;and read distinctly, quoth my father.&mdash;I
will, an' please your Honour, replied the Corporal, making a bow,
and bespeaking attention with a slight movement of his right
hand.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XLII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;But before the Corporal begins, I must first give you a
description of his attitude;&mdash;otherwise he will naturally
stand represented, by your imagination, in an uneasy
posture,&mdash;stiff,&mdash;perpendicular,&mdash;dividing the
weight of his body equally upon both legs;&mdash;his eye fixed, as
if on duty;&mdash;his look determined,&mdash;clenching the sermon
in his left hand, like his firelock.&mdash;In a word, you would be
apt to paint Trim, as if he was standing in his platoon ready for
action,&mdash;His attitude was as unlike all this as you can
conceive.</p>
<p>He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards
just so far, as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the
plain of the horizon;&mdash;which sound orators, to whom I address
this, know very well to be the true persuasive angle of
incidence;&mdash;in any other angle you may talk and
preach;&mdash;'tis certain;&mdash;and it is done every
day;&mdash;but with what effect,&mdash;I leave the world to
judge!</p>
<p>The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to
a mathematical exactness,&mdash;does it not shew us, by the way,
how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other?</p>
<p>How the duce Corporal Trim, who knew not so much as an acute
angle from an obtuse one, came to hit it so exactly;&mdash;or
whether it was chance or nature, or good sense or imitation,
&amp;c. shall be commented upon in that part of the cyclopaedia of
arts and sciences, where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of
the senate, the pulpit, and the bar, the coffee-house, the
bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under consideration.</p>
<p>He stood,&mdash;for I repeat it, to take the picture of him in
at one view, with his body swayed, and somewhat bent
forwards,&mdash;his right leg from under him, sustaining
seven-eighths of his whole weight,&mdash;the foot of his left leg,
the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude, advanced a
little,&mdash;not laterally, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt
them;&mdash;his knee bent, but that not violently,&mdash;but so as
to fall within the limits of the line of beauty;&mdash;and I add,
of the line of science too;&mdash;for consider, it had one eighth
part of his body to bear up;&mdash;so that in this case the
position of the leg is determined,&mdash;because the foot could be
no farther advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow
him, mechanically to receive an eighth part of his whole weight
under it, and to carry it too.</p>
<p>&gt;This I recommend to painters;&mdash;need I add,&mdash;to
orators!&mdash;I think not; for unless they practise it,&mdash;they
must fall upon their noses.</p>
<p>So much for Corporal Trim's body and legs.&mdash;He held the
sermon loosely, not carelessly, in his left hand, raised something
above his stomach, and detached a little from his breast;&mdash;his
right arm falling negligently by his side, as nature and the laws
of gravity ordered it,&mdash;but with the palm of it open and
turned towards his audience, ready to aid the sentiment in case it
stood in need.</p>
<p>Corporal Trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full
harmony with the other parts of him;&mdash;he looked
frank,&mdash;unconstrained,&mdash; something assured,&mdash;but not
bordering upon assurance.</p>
<p>Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all
this.&mdash;I've told him it should be explained;&mdash;but so he
stood before my father, my uncle Toby, and Dr. Slop,&mdash;so
swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs, and with such an
oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,&mdash;a statuary
might have modelled from it;&mdash;nay, I doubt whether the oldest
Fellow of a College,&mdash;or the Hebrew Professor himself, could
have much mended it.</p>
<p>Trim made a bow, and read as follows:</p>
<p>The Sermon.</p>
<p>Hebrews xiii. 18.</p>
<p>&mdash;For we trust we have a good Conscience.</p>
<p>'Trust!&mdash;Trust we have a good conscience!'</p>
<p>(Certainly, Trim, quoth my father, interrupting him, you give
that sentence a very improper accent; for you curl up your nose,
man, and read it with such a sneering tone, as if the Parson was
going to abuse the Apostle.</p>
<p>He is, an' please your Honour, replied Trim. Pugh! said my
father, smiling.</p>
<p>Sir, quoth Dr. Slop, Trim is certainly in the right; for the
writer (who I perceive is a Protestant) by the snappish manner in
which he takes up the apostle, is certainly going to abuse
him;&mdash;if this treatment of him has not done it already. But
from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so soon, Dr.
Slop, that the writer is of our church?&mdash;for aught I can see
yet,&mdash;he may be of any church.&mdash;Because, answered Dr.
Slop, if he was of ours,&mdash;he durst no more take such a
licence,&mdash;than a bear by his beard:&mdash;If, in our
communion, Sir, a man was to insult an apostle,&mdash;a
saint,&mdash;or even the paring of a saint's nail,&mdash;he would
have his eyes scratched out.&mdash;What, by the saint? quoth my
uncle Toby. No, replied Dr. Slop, he would have an old house over
his head. Pray is the Inquisition an ancient building, answered my
uncle Toby, or is it a modern one?&mdash;I know nothing of
architecture, replied Dr. Slop.&mdash;An' please your Honours,
quoth Trim, the Inquisition is the vilest&mdash;Prithee spare thy
description, Trim, I hate the very name of it, said my
father.&mdash;No matter for that, answered Dr. Slop,&mdash;it has
its uses; for tho' I'm no great advocate for it, yet, in such a
case as this, he would soon be taught better manners; and I can
tell him, if he went on at that rate, would be flung into the
Inquisition for his pains. God help him then, quoth my uncle Toby.
Amen, added Trim; for Heaven above knows, I have a poor brother who
has been fourteen years a captive in it.&mdash;I never heard one
word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily:&mdash;How came he
there, Trim?&mdash;O, Sir, the story will make your heart
bleed,&mdash;as it has made mine a thousand times;&mdash;but it is
too long to be told now;&mdash;your Honour shall hear it from first
to last some day when I am working beside you in our
fortifications;&mdash;but the short of the story is
this;&mdash;That my brother Tom went over a servant to
Lisbon,&mdash;and then married a Jew's widow, who kept a small
shop, and sold sausages, which somehow or other, was the cause of
his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where he
was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried
directly to the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued Trim,
fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart,&mdash;the poor honest
lad lies confined at this hour; he was as honest a soul, added
Trim, (pulling out his handkerchief) as ever blood
warmed.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The tears trickled down Trim's cheeks faster than he
could well wipe them away.&mdash;A dead silence in the room ensued
for some minutes.&mdash;Certain proof of pity!</p>
<p>Come Trim, quoth my father, after he saw the poor fellow's grief
had got a little vent,&mdash;read on,&mdash;and put this melancholy
story out of thy head:&mdash;I grieve that I interrupted thee; but
prithee begin the sermon again;&mdash;for if the first sentence in
it is matter of abuse, as thou sayest, I have a great desire to
know what kind of provocation the apostle has given.</p>
<p>Corporal Trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into
his pocket, and, making a bow as he did it,&mdash;he began
again.)</p>
<p>The Sermon.</p>
<p>Hebrews xiii. 18.</p>
<p>&mdash;For we trust we have a good Conscience.&mdash;</p>
<p>'Trust! trust we have a good conscience! Surely if there is any
thing in this life which a man may depend upon, and to the
knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most
indisputable evidence, it must be this very thing,&mdash;whether he
has a good conscience or no.'</p>
<p>(I am positive I am right, quoth Dr. Slop.)</p>
<p>'If a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a stranger to the
true state of this account:&mdash;he must be privy to his own
thoughts and desires;&mdash;he must remember his past pursuits, and
know certainly the true springs and motives, which, in general,
have governed the actions of his life.'</p>
<p>(I defy him, without an assistant, quoth Dr. Slop.)</p>
<p>'In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances; and,
as the wise man complains, hardly do we guess aright at the things
that are upon the earth, and with labour do we find the things that
are before us. But here the mind has all the evidence and facts
within herself;&mdash;is conscious of the web she has
wove;&mdash;knows its texture and fineness, and the exact share
which every passion has had in working upon the several designs
which virtue or vice has planned before her.'</p>
<p>(The language is good, and I declare Trim reads very well, quoth
my father.)</p>
<p>'Now,&mdash;as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge
which the mind has within herself of this; and the judgment, either
of approbation or censure, which it unavoidably makes upon the
successive actions of our lives; 'tis plain you will say, from the
very terms of the proposition,&mdash;whenever this inward testimony
goes against a man, and he stands self-accused, that he must
necessarily be a guilty man.&mdash;And, on the contrary, when the
report is favourable on his side, and his heart condemns him
not:&mdash;that it is not a matter of trust, as the apostle
intimates, but a matter of certainty and fact, that the conscience
is good, and that the man must be good also.'</p>
<p>(Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, I suppose, quoth
Dr. Slop, and the Protestant divine is in the right. Sir, have
patience, replied my father, for I think it will presently appear
that St. Paul and the Protestant divine are both of an
opinion.&mdash;As nearly so, quoth Dr. Slop, as east is to
west;&mdash;but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes from
the liberty of the press.</p>
<p>It is no more at the worst, replied my uncle Toby, than the
liberty of the pulpit; for it does not appear that the sermon is
printed, or ever likely to be.</p>
<p>Go on, Trim, quoth my father.)</p>
<p>'At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case:
and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so
truly impressed upon the mind of man,&mdash;that did no such thing
ever happen, as that the conscience of a man, by long habits of
sin, might (as the scripture assures it may) insensibly become
hard;&mdash;and, like some tender parts of his body, by much stress
and continual hard usage, lose by degrees that nice sense and
perception with which God and nature endowed it:&mdash;Did this
never happen;&mdash;or was it certain that self-love could never
hang the least bias upon the judgment;&mdash;or that the little
interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our
upper regions, and encompass them about with clouds and thick
darkness:&mdash;Could no such thing as favour and affection enter
this sacred Court&mdash;Did Wit disdain to take a bribe in
it;&mdash;or was ashamed to shew its face as an advocate for an
unwarrantable enjoyment: Or, lastly, were we assured that Interest
stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing&mdash;and
that Passion never got into the judgment-seat, and pronounced
sentence in the stead of Reason, which is supposed always to
preside and determine upon the case:&mdash;Was this truly so, as
the objection must suppose;&mdash;no doubt then the religious and
moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed
it:&mdash;and the guilt or innocence of every man's life could be
known, in general, by no better measure, than the degrees of his
own approbation and censure.</p>
<p>'I own, in one case, whenever a man's conscience does accuse him
(as it seldom errs on that side) that he is guilty;&mdash;and
unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases, we may safely
pronounce upon it, that there is always sufficient grounds for the
accusation.</p>
<p>'But the converse of the proposition will not hold
true;&mdash;namely, that whenever there is guilt, the conscience
must accuse; and if it does not, that a man is therefore
innocent.&mdash;This is not fact&mdash;So that the common
consolation which some good christian or other is hourly
administering to himself,&mdash;that he thanks God his mind does
not misgive him; and that, consequently, he has a good conscience,
because he hath a quiet one,&mdash;is fallacious;&mdash;and as
current as the inference is, and as infallible as the rule appears
at first sight, yet when you look nearer to it, and try the truth
of this rule upon plain facts,&mdash;you see it liable to so much
error from a false application;&mdash;the principle upon which it
goes so often perverted;&mdash;the whole force of it lost, and
sometimes so vilely cast away, that it is painful to produce the
common examples from human life, which confirm the account.</p>
<p>'A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his
principles;&mdash;exceptionable in his conduct to the world; shall
live shameless, in the open commission of a sin which no reason or
pretence can justify,&mdash;a sin by which, contrary to all the
workings of humanity, he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of
his guilt;&mdash;rob her of her best dowry; and not only cover her
own head with dishonour;&mdash;but involve a whole virtuous family
in shame and sorrow for her sake. Surely, you will think conscience
must lead such a man a troublesome life; he can have no rest night
and day from its reproaches.</p>
<p>'Alas! Conscience had something else to do all this time, than
break in upon him; as Elijah reproached the god Baal,&mdash;this
domestic god was either talking, or pursuing, or was in a journey,
or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke.</p>
<p>'Perhaps He was gone out in company with Honour to fight a duel:
to pay off some debt at play;&mdash;or dirty annuity, the bargain
of his lust; Perhaps Conscience all this time was engaged at home,
talking aloud against petty larceny, and executing vengeance upon
some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him
against all temptation of committing; so that he lives as
merrily;'&mdash;(If he was of our church, tho', quoth Dr. Slop, he
could not)&mdash;'sleeps as soundly in his bed;&mdash;and at last
meets death unconcernedly;&mdash;perhaps much more so, than a much
better man.'</p>
<p>(All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr. Slop, turning to my
father,&mdash;the case could not happen in our church.&mdash;It
happens in ours, however, replied my father, but too often.&mdash;I
own, quoth Dr. Slop, (struck a little with my father's frank
acknowledgment)&mdash;that a man in the Romish church may live as
badly;&mdash;but then he cannot easily die so.&mdash;'Tis little
matter, replied my father, with an air of indifference,&mdash;how a
rascal dies.&mdash;I mean, answered Dr. Slop, he would be denied
the benefits of the last sacraments.&mdash;Pray how many have you
in all, said my uncle Toby,&mdash;for I always forget?&mdash;Seven,
answered Dr. Slop.&mdash;Humph!&mdash;said my uncle Toby; tho' not
accented as a note of acquiescence,&mdash;but as an interjection of
that particular species of surprize, when a man in looking into a
drawer, finds more of a thing than he expected.&mdash;Humph!
replied my uncle Toby. Dr. Slop, who had an ear, understood my
uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the
seven sacraments.&mdash;Humph! replied Dr. Slop, (stating my uncle
Toby's argument over again to him)&mdash;Why, Sir, are there not
seven cardinal virtues?&mdash;Seven mortal sins?&mdash;Seven golden
candlesticks?&mdash;Seven heavens?&mdash;'Tis more than I know,
replied my uncle Toby.&mdash;Are there not seven wonders of the
world?&mdash;Seven days of the creation?&mdash;Seven
planets?&mdash;Seven plagues?&mdash;That there are, quoth my father
with a most affected gravity. But prithee, continued he, go on with
the rest of thy characters, Trim.)</p>
<p>'Another is sordid, unmerciful,' (here Trim waved his right
hand) 'a strait-hearted, selfish wretch, incapable either of
private friendship or public spirit. Take notice how he passes by
the widow and orphan in their distress, and sees all the miseries
incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer.' (An' please
your honours, cried Trim, I think this a viler man than the
other.)</p>
<p>'Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such
occasions?&mdash;No; thank God there is no occasion, I pay every
man his own;&mdash;I have no fornication to answer to my
conscience;&mdash;no faithless vows or promises to make up;&mdash;I
have debauched no man's wife or child; thank God, I am not as other
men, adulterers, unjust, or even as this libertine, who stands
before me.</p>
<p>'A third is crafty and designing in his nature. View his whole
life;&mdash;'tis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and
unequitable subterfuges, basely to defeat the true intent of all
laws,&mdash;plain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several
properties.&mdash;You will see such a one working out a frame of
little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and
needy man;&mdash;shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a
youth, or the unsuspecting temper of his friend, who would have
trusted him with his life.</p>
<p>'When old age comes on, and repentance calls him to look back
upon this black account, and state it over again with his
conscience&mdash;Conscience looks into the Statutes at
Large;&mdash;finds no express law broken by what he has
done;&mdash;perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and
chattels incurred;&mdash;sees no scourge waving over his head, or
prison opening his gates upon him:&mdash;What is there to affright
his conscience?&mdash;Conscience has got safely entrenched behind
the Letter of the Law; sits there invulnerable, fortified with
Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides;&mdash;that it is not
preaching can dispossess it of its hold.'</p>
<p>(Here Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby exchanged looks with each
other.&mdash;Aye, Aye, Trim! quoth my uncle Toby, shaking his
head,&mdash;these are but sorry fortifications, Trim.&mdash;O! very
poor work, answered Trim, to what your Honour and I make of
it.&mdash;The character of this last man, said Dr. Slop,
interrupting Trim, is more detestable than all the rest; and seems
to have been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst
you:&mdash;Amongst us, a man's conscience could not possibly
continue so long blinded,&mdash;three times in a year, at least, he
must go to confession. Will that restore it to sight? quoth my
uncle Toby,&mdash;Go on, Trim, quoth my father, or Obadiah will
have got back before thou has got to the end of thy
sermon.&mdash;'Tis a very short one, replied Trim.&mdash;I wish it
was longer, quoth my uncle Toby, for I like it hugely.&mdash;Trim
went on.)</p>
<p>'A fourth man shall want even this refuge;&mdash;shall break
through all their ceremony of slow chicane;&mdash;scorns the
doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring
about his purpose:&mdash;See the bare-faced villain, how he cheats,
lies, perjures, robs, murders!&mdash;Horrid!&mdash;But indeed much
better was not to be expected, in the present case&mdash;the poor
man was in the dark!&mdash;his priest had got the keeping of his
conscience;&mdash;and all he would let him know of it, was, That he
must believe in the Pope;&mdash;go to Mass;&mdash;cross
himself;&mdash;tell his beads;&mdash;be a good Catholic, and that
this, in all conscience, was enough to carry him to heaven.
What;&mdash;if he perjures?&mdash;Why;&mdash;he had a mental
reservation in it.&mdash;But if he is so wicked and abandoned a
wretch as you represent him;&mdash;if he robs,&mdash;if he stabs,
will not conscience, on every such act, receive a wound
itself?&mdash;Aye,&mdash;but the man has carried it to
confession;&mdash;the wound digests there, and will do well enough,
and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution. O Popery!
what hast thou to answer for!&mdash;when not content with the too
many natural and fatal ways, thro' which the heart of man is every
day thus treacherous to itself above all things;&mdash;thou hast
wilfully set open the wide gate of deceit before the face of this
unwary traveller, too apt, God knows, to go astray of himself, and
confidently speak peace to himself, when there is no peace.</p>
<p>'Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life,
are too notorious to require much evidence. If any man doubts the
reality of them, or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a
bubble to himself,&mdash;I must refer him a moment to his own
reflections, and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own
heart.</p>
<p>'Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation,
numbers of wicked actions stand there, tho' equally bad and vicious
in their own natures;&mdash;he will soon find, that such of them as
strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit, are
generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which
a soft and a flattering hand can give them;&mdash;and that the
others, to which he feels no propensity, appear, at once, naked and
deformed, surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and
dishonour.</p>
<p>'When David surprized Saul sleeping in the cave, and cut off the
skirt of his robe&mdash;we read his heart smote him for what he had
done:&mdash;But in the matter of Uriah, where a faithful and
gallant servant, whom he ought to have loved and honoured, fell to
make way for his lust,&mdash;where conscience had so much greater
reason to take the alarm, his heart smote him not. A whole year had
almost passed from first commission of that crime, to the time
Nathan was sent to reprove him; and we read not once of the least
sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified, during all that
time, for what he had done.</p>
<p>'Thus conscience, this once able monitor,&mdash;placed on high
as a judge within us, and intended by our maker as a just and
equitable one too,&mdash;by an unhappy train of causes and
impediments, takes often such imperfect cognizance of what
passes,&mdash;does its office so negligently,&mdash;sometimes so
corruptly,&mdash;that it is not to be trusted alone; and therefore
we find there is a necessity, an absolute necessity, of joining
another principle with it, to aid, if not govern, its
determinations.</p>
<p>'So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of
infinite importance to you not to be misled in,&mdash;namely, in
what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man, an
useful citizen, a faithful subject to your king, or a good servant
to your God,&mdash;call in religion and morality.&mdash;Look, What
is written in the law of God?&mdash;How readest thou?&mdash;Consult
calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and
truth;&mdash;what say they?</p>
<p>'Let Conscience determine the matter upon these
reports;&mdash;and then if thy heart condemns thee not, which is
the case the apostle supposes,&mdash;the rule will be
infallible;'&mdash;(Here Dr. Slop fell asleep)&mdash;'thou wilt
have confidence towards God;&mdash;that is, have just grounds to
believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself, is the judgment
of God; and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous
sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that
Being, to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy
actions.</p>
<p>'Blessed is the man, indeed, then, as the author of the book of
Ecclesiasticus expresses it, who is not pricked with the multitude
of his sins: Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him;
whether he be rich, or whether he be poor, if he have a good heart
(a heart thus guided and informed) he shall at all times rejoice in
a chearful countenance; his mind shall tell him more than seven
watch-men that sit above upon a tower on high.'&mdash;(A tower has
no strength, quoth my uncle Toby, unless 'tis flank'd.)&mdash;'in
the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand
casuists, and give the state he lives in, a better security for his
behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put together, which
law-makers are forced to multiply:&mdash;Forced, I say, as things
stand; human laws not being a matter of original choice, but of
pure necessity, brought in to fence against the mischievous effects
of those consciences which are no law unto themselves; well
intending, by the many provisions made,&mdash;that in all such
corrupt and misguided cases, where principles and the checks of
conscience will not make us upright,&mdash;to supply their force,
and, by the terrors of gaols and halters, oblige us to it.'</p>
<p>(I see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been
composed to be preached at the Temple,&mdash;or at some
Assize.&mdash;I like the reasoning,&mdash;and am sorry that Dr.
Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction:&mdash;for
it is now clear, that the Parson, as I thought at first, never
insulted St. Paul in the least;&mdash;nor has there been, brother,
the least difference between them.&mdash;A great matter, if they
had differed, replied my uncle Toby,&mdash;the best friends in the
world may differ sometimes.&mdash;True,&mdash;brother Toby quoth my
father, shaking hands with him,&mdash;we'll fill our pipes,
brother, and then Trim shall go on.</p>
<p>Well,&mdash;what dost thou think of it? said my father, speaking
to Corporal Trim, as he reached his tobacco-box.</p>
<p>I think, answered the Corporal, that the seven watch-men upon
the tower, who, I suppose, are all centinels there,&mdash;are more,
an' please your Honour, than were necessary;&mdash;and, to go on at
that rate, would harrass a regiment all to pieces, which a
commanding officer, who loves his men, will never do, if he can
help it, because two centinels, added the Corporal, are as good as
twenty.&mdash;I have been a commanding officer myself in the Corps
de Garde a hundred times, continued Trim, rising an inch higher in
his figure, as he spoke,&mdash;and all the time I had the honour to
serve his Majesty King William, in relieving the most considerable
posts, I never left more than two in my life.&mdash;Very right,
Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,&mdash;but you do not consider, Trim,
that the towers, in Solomon's days, were not such things as our
bastions, flanked and defended by other works;&mdash;this, Trim,
was an invention since Solomon's death; nor had they horn-works, or
ravelins before the curtin, in his time;&mdash;or such a fosse as
we make with a cuvette in the middle of it, and with covered ways
and counterscarps pallisadoed along it, to guard against a Coup de
main:&mdash;So that the seven men upon the tower were a party, I
dare say, from the Corps de Garde, set there, not only to look out,
but to defend it.&mdash;They could be no more, an' please your
Honour, than a Corporal's Guard.&mdash;My father smiled inwardly,
but not outwardly&mdash;the subject being rather too serious,
considering what had happened, to make a jest of.&mdash;So putting
his pipe into his mouth, which he had just lighted,&mdash;he
contented himself with ordering Trim to read on. He read on as
follows:</p>
<p>'To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual
dealings with each other, to govern our actions by the eternal
measures of right and wrong:&mdash;The first of these will
comprehend the duties of religion;&mdash;the second, those of
morality, which are so inseparably connected together, that you
cannot divide these two tables, even in imagination, (tho' the
attempt is often made in practice) without breaking and mutually
destroying them both.</p>
<p>I said the attempt is often made; and so it is;&mdash;there
being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all
of religion, and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none,
who would take it as the bitterest affront, should you but hint at
a suspicion of his moral character,&mdash;or imagine he was not
conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite.</p>
<p>'When there is some appearance that it is so,&mdash;tho' one is
unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as
moral honesty, yet were we to look into the grounds of it, in the
present case, I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy
such a one the honour of his motive.</p>
<p>'Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject, it
will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his
interest, his pride, his ease, or some such little and changeable
passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in
matters of great distress.</p>
<p>'I will illustrate this by an example.</p>
<p>'I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I usually call
in,'&mdash;(There is no need, cried Dr. Slop, (waking) to call in
any physician in this case)&mdash;'to be neither of them men of
much religion: I hear them make a jest of it every day, and treat
all its sanctions with so much scorn, as to put the matter past
doubt. Well;&mdash;notwithstanding this, I put my fortune into the
hands of the one:&mdash;and what is dearer still to me, I trust my
life to the honest skill of the other.</p>
<p>'Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence.
Why, in the first place, I believe there is no probability that
either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my
disadvantage;&mdash;I consider that honesty serves the purposes of
this life:&mdash;I know their success in the world depends upon the
fairness of their characters.&mdash;In a word, I'm persuaded that
they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more.</p>
<p>'But put it otherwise, namely, that interest lay, for once, on
the other side; that a case should happen, wherein the one, without
stain to his reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me
naked in the world;&mdash;or that the other could send me out of
it, and enjoy an estate by my death, without dishonour to himself
or his art:&mdash;In this case, what hold have I of either of
them?&mdash;Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the
question;&mdash;Interest, the next most powerful motive in the
world, is strongly against me:&mdash;What have I left to cast into
the opposite scale to balance this temptation?&mdash;Alas! I have
nothing,&mdash;nothing but what is lighter than a bubble&mdash;I
must lie at the mercy of Honour, or some such capricious
principle&mdash;Strait security for two of the most valuable
blessings!&mdash;my property and myself.</p>
<p>'As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon morality without
religion;&mdash;so, on the other hand, there is nothing better to
be expected from religion without morality; nevertheless, 'tis no
prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low,
who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a
religious man.</p>
<p>'He shall not only be covetous, revengeful,
implacable,&mdash;but even wanting in points of common honesty; yet
inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the
age,&mdash;is zealous for some points of religion,&mdash;goes twice
a day to church,&mdash;attends the sacraments,&mdash;and amuses
himself with a few instrumental parts of religion,&mdash;shall
cheat his conscience into a judgment, that, for this, he is a
religious man, and has discharged truly his duty to God: And you
will find that such a man, through force of this delusion,
generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who
has less affectation of piety,&mdash;though, perhaps, ten times
more real honesty than himself.</p>
<p>'This likewise is a sore evil under the sun; and I believe,
there is no one mistaken principle, which, for its time, has
wrought more serious mischiefs.&mdash;For a general proof of
this,&mdash;examine the history of the Romish church;'&mdash;(Well
what can you make of that? cried Dr. Slop)&mdash;'see what scenes
of cruelty, murder, rapine, bloodshed,'&mdash;(They may thank their
own obstinacy, cried Dr. Slop)&mdash;have all been sanctified by a
religion not strictly governed by morality.</p>
<p>'In how many kingdoms of the world'&mdash;(Here Trim kept waving
his right-hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm, returning
it backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph.)</p>
<p>'In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of
this misguided saint-errant, spared neither age or merit, or sex,
or condition?&mdash;and, as he fought under the banners of a
religion which set him loose from justice and humanity, he shewed
none; mercilessly trampled upon both,&mdash;heard neither the cries
of the unfortunate, nor pitied their distresses.'</p>
<p>(I have been in many a battle, an' please your Honour, quoth
Trim, sighing, but never in so melancholy a one as this,&mdash;I
would not have drawn a tricker in it against these poor
souls,&mdash;to have been made a general officer.&mdash;Why? what
do you understand of the affair? said Dr. Slop, looking towards
Trim, with something more of contempt than the Corporal's honest
heart deserved.&mdash;What do you know, friend, about this battle
you talk of?&mdash;I know, replied Trim, that I never refused
quarter in my life to any man who cried out for it;&mdash;but to a
woman or a child, continued Trim, before I would level my musket at
them, I would loose my life a thousand times.&mdash;Here's a crown
for thee, Trim, to drink with Obadiah to-night, quoth my uncle
Toby, and I'll give Obadiah another too.&mdash;God bless your
Honour, replied Trim,&mdash;I had rather these poor women and
children had it.&mdash;thou art an honest fellow, quoth my uncle
Toby.&mdash;My father nodded his head, as much as to say&mdash;and
so he is.&mdash;</p>
<p>But prithee, Trim, said my father, make an end,&mdash;for I see
thou hast but a leaf or two left.</p>
<p>Corporal Trim read on.)</p>
<p>'If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not
sufficient,&mdash;consider at this instant, how the votaries of
that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to
God, by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to
themselves.</p>
<p>'To be convinced of this, go with me for a moment into the
prisons of the Inquisition.'&mdash;(God help my poor brother
Tom.)&mdash;'Behold Religion, with Mercy and Justice chained down
under her feet,&mdash;there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal,
propped up with racks and instruments of torment. Hark!&mdash;hark!
what a piteous groan!'&mdash;(Here Trim's face turned as pale as
ashes.)&mdash;'See the melancholy wretch who uttered
it'&mdash;(Here the tears began to trickle down)&mdash;'just
brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial, and endure
the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to
invent.'&mdash;(D..n them all, quoth Trim, his colour returning
into his face as red as blood.)&mdash;'Behold this helpless victim
delivered up to his tormentors,&mdash;his body so wasted with
sorrow and confinement.'&mdash;(Oh! 'tis my brother, cried poor
Trim in a most passionate exclamation, dropping the sermon upon the
ground, and clapping his hands together&mdash;I fear 'tis poor Tom.
My father's and my uncle Toby's heart yearned with sympathy for the
poor fellow's distress; even Slop himself acknowledged pity for
him.&mdash;Why, Trim, said my father, this is not a
history,&mdash;'tis a sermon thou art reading; prithee begin the
sentence again.)&mdash;'Behold this helpless victim delivered up to
his tormentors,&mdash;his body so wasted with sorrow and
confinement, you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers.</p>
<p>'Observe the last movement of that horrid engine!'&mdash;(I
would rather face a cannon, quoth Trim, stamping.)&mdash;'See what
convulsions it has thrown him into!&mdash;Consider the nature of
the posture in which he how lies stretched,&mdash;what exquisite
tortures he endures by it!'&mdash;(I hope 'tis not in
Portugal.)&mdash;''Tis all nature can bear! Good God! see how it
keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips!' (I would not
read another line of it, quoth Trim for all this world;&mdash;I
fear, an' please your Honours, all this is in Portugal, where my
poor brother Tom is. I tell thee, Trim, again, quoth my father,
'tis not an historical account,&mdash;'tis a
description.&mdash;'Tis only a description, honest man, quoth Slop,
there's not a word of truth in it.&mdash;That's another story,
replied my father.&mdash;However, as Trim reads it with so much
concern,&mdash;'tis cruelty to force him to go on with
it.&mdash;Give me hold of the sermon, Trim,&mdash;I'll finish it
for thee, and thou may'st go. I must stay and hear it too, replied
Trim, if your Honour will allow me;&mdash;tho' I would not read it
myself for a Colonel's pay.&mdash;Poor Trim! quoth my uncle Toby.
My father went on.)</p>
<p>'&mdash;Consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies
stretched,&mdash;what exquisite torture he endures by
it!&mdash;'Tis all nature can bear! Good God! See how it keeps his
weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips,&mdash;willing to take
its leave,&mdash;but not suffered to depart!&mdash;Behold the
unhappy wretch led back to his cell!'&mdash;(Then, thank God,
however, quoth Trim, they have not killed him.)&mdash;'See him
dragged out of it again to meet the flames, and the insults in his
last agonies, which this principle,&mdash;this principle, that
there can be religion without mercy, has prepared for
him.'&mdash;(Then, thank God,&mdash;he is dead, quoth
Trim,&mdash;he is out of his pain,&mdash;and they have done their
worst at him.&mdash;O Sirs!&mdash;Hold your peace, Trim, said my
father, going on with the sermon, lest Trim should incense Dr.
Slop,&mdash;we shall never have done at this rate.)</p>
<p>'The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is, to
trace down the consequences such a notion has produced, and compare
them with the spirit of Christianity;&mdash;'tis the short and
decisive rule which our Saviour hath left us, for these and such
like cases, and it is worth a thousand arguments&mdash;By their
fruits ye shall know them.</p>
<p>'I will add no farther to the length of this sermon, than by two
or three short and independent rules deducible from it.</p>
<p>'First, Whenever a man talks loudly against religion, always
suspect that it is not his reason, but his passions, which have got
the better of his Creed. A bad life and a good belief are
disagreeable and troublesome neighbours, and where they separate,
depend upon it, 'tis for no other cause but quietness sake.</p>
<p>'Secondly, When a man, thus represented, tells you in any
particular instance,&mdash;That such a thing goes against his
conscience,&mdash;always believe he means exactly the same thing,
as when he tells you such a thing goes against his stomach;&mdash;a
present want of appetite being generally the true cause of
both.</p>
<p>'In a word,&mdash;trust that man in nothing, who has not a
Conscience in every thing.</p>
<p>'And, in your own case, remember this plain distinction, a
mistake in which has ruined thousands,&mdash;that your conscience
is not a law;&mdash;No, God and reason made the law, and have
placed conscience within you to determine;&mdash;not, like an
Asiatic Cadi, according to the ebbs and flows of his own
passions,&mdash;but like a British judge in this land of liberty
and good sense, who makes no new law, but faithfully declares that
law which he knows already written.'</p>
<p>Finis.</p>
<p>Thou hast read the sermon extremely well, Trim, quoth my
father.&mdash;If he had spared his comments, replied Dr.
Slop,&mdash;he would have read it much better. I should have read
it ten times better, Sir, answered Trim, but that my heart was so
full.&mdash;That was the very reason, Trim, replied my father,
which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done; and
if the clergy of our church, continued my father, addressing
himself to Dr. Slop, would take part in what they deliver as deeply
as this poor fellow has done,&mdash;as their compositions are
fine;&mdash;(I deny it, quoth Dr. Slop)&mdash;I maintain
it,&mdash;that the eloquence of our pulpits, with such subjects to
enflame it, would be a model for the whole world:&mdash;But alas!
continued my father, and I own it, Sir, with sorrow, that, like
French politicians in this respect, what they gain in the cabinet
they lose in the field.&mdash;'Twere a pity, quoth my uncle, that
this should be lost. I like the sermon well, replied my
father,&mdash;'tis dramatick,&mdash;and there is something in that
way of writing, when skilfully managed, which catches the
attention.&mdash;We preach much in that way with us, said Dr.
Slop.&mdash;I know that very well, said my father,&mdash;but in a
tone and manner which disgusted Dr. Slop, full as much as his
assent, simply, could have pleased him.&mdash;But in this, added
Dr. Slop, a little piqued,&mdash;our sermons have greatly the
advantage, that we never introduce any character into them below a
patriarch or a patriarch's wife, or a martyr or a
saint.&mdash;There are some very bad characters in this, however,
said my father, and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for
'em.&mdash;But pray, quoth my uncle Toby,&mdash;who's can this
be?&mdash;How could it get into my Stevinus? A man must be as great
a conjurer as Stevinus, said my father, to resolve the second
question:&mdash;The first, I think, is not so difficult;&mdash;for
unless my judgment greatly deceives me,&mdash;I know the author,
for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish.</p>
<p>The similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my
father constantly had heard preached in his parish-church, was the
ground of his conjecture,&mdash;proving it as strongly, as an
argument a priori could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind,
That it was Yorick's and no one's else:&mdash;It was proved to be
so, a posteriori, the day after, when Yorick sent a servant to my
uncle Toby's house to enquire after it.</p>
<p>It seems that Yorick, who was inquisitive after all kinds of
knowledge, had borrowed Stevinus of my uncle Toby, and had
carelesly popped his sermon, as soon as he had made it, into the
middle of Stevinus; and by an act of forgetfulness, to which he was
ever subject, he had sent Stevinus home, and his sermon to keep him
company.</p>
<p>Ill-fated sermon! Thou wast lost, after this recovery of thee, a
second time, dropped thru' an unsuspected fissure in thy master's
pocket, down into a treacherous and a tattered lining,&mdash;trod
deep into the dirt by the left hind-foot of his Rosinante inhumanly
stepping upon thee as thou falledst;&mdash;buried ten days in the
mire,&mdash;raised up out of it by a beggar,&mdash;sold for a
halfpenny to a parish-clerk,&mdash;transferred to his
parson,&mdash;lost for ever to thy own, the remainder of his
days,&mdash;nor restored to his restless Manes till this very
moment, that I tell the world the story.</p>
<p>Can the reader believe, that this sermon of Yorick's was
preached at an assize, in the cathedral of York, before a thousand
witnesses, ready to give oath of it, by a certain prebendary of
that church, and actually printed by him when he had
done,&mdash;and within so short a space as two years and three
months after Yorick's death?&mdash;Yorick indeed, was never better
served in his life;&mdash;but it was a little hard to maltreat him
after, and plunder him after he was laid in his grave.</p>
<p>However, as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with
Yorick,&mdash;and, in conscious justice, printed but a few copies
to give away;&mdash;and that I am told he could moreover have made
as good a one himself, had he thought fit,&mdash;I declare I would
not have published this anecdote to the world;&mdash;nor do I
publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in
the church;&mdash;I leave that to others;&mdash;but I find myself
impelled by two reasons, which I cannot withstand.</p>
<p>The first is, That in doing justice, I may give rest to Yorick's
ghost;&mdash;which&mdash;as the country-people, and some others
believe,&mdash;still walks.</p>
<p>The second reason is, That, by laying open this story to the
world, I gain an opportunity of informing it,&mdash;That in case
the character of parson Yorick, and this sample of his sermons, is
liked,&mdash;there are now in the possession of the Shandy family,
as many as will make a handsome volume, at the world's
service,&mdash;and much good may they do it.</p>

<p>Obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;&mdash;for he came
in jingling, with all the instruments in the green baize bag we
spoke of, flung across his body, just as Corporal Trim went out of
the room.</p>
<p>It is now proper, I think, quoth Dr. Slop, (clearing up his
looks) as we are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs.
Shandy, to send up stairs to know how she goes on.</p>
<p>I have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down
to us upon the least difficulty;&mdash;for you must know, Dr. Slop,
continued my father, with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his
countenance, that by express treaty, solemnly ratified between me
and my wife, you are no more than an auxiliary in this
affair,&mdash;and not so much as that,&mdash;unless the lean old
mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you.&mdash;Women
have their particular fancies, and in points of this nature,
continued my father, where they bear the whole burden, and suffer
so much acute pain for the advantage of our families, and the good
of the species,&mdash;they claim a right of deciding, en
Souveraines, in whose hands, and in what fashion, they choose to
undergo it.</p>
<p>They are in the right of it,&mdash;quoth my uncle Toby. But Sir,
replied Dr. Slop, not taking notice of my uncle Toby's opinion, but
turning to my father,&mdash;they had better govern in other
points;&mdash;and a father of a family, who wishes its perpetuity,
in my opinion, had better exchange this prerogative with them, and
give up some other rights in lieu of it.&mdash;I know not, quoth my
father, answering a letter too testily, to be quite dispassionate
in what he said,&mdash;I know not, quoth he, what we have left to
give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world,
unless that,&mdash;of who shall beget them.&mdash;One would almost
give up any thing, replied Dr. Slop.&mdash;I beg your
pardon,&mdash;answered my uncle Toby.&mdash;Sir, replied Dr. Slop,
it would astonish you to know what improvements we have made of
late years in all branches of obstetrical knowledge, but
particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious
extraction of the foetus,&mdash;which has received such lights,
that, for my part (holding up his hand) I declare I wonder how the
world has&mdash;I wish, quoth my uncle Toby, you had seen what
prodigious armies we had in Flanders.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.XLIV.</h2>
<p>I have dropped the curtain over this scene for a
minute,&mdash;to remind you of one thing,&mdash;and to inform you
of another.</p>
<p>What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due
course;&mdash;for it should have been told a hundred and fifty
pages ago, but that I foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter,
and be of more advantage here than elsewhere.&mdash;Writers had
need look before them, to keep up the spirit and connection of what
they have in hand.</p>
<p>When these two things are done,&mdash;the curtain shall be drawn
up again, and my uncle Toby, my father, and Dr. Slop, shall go on
with their discourse, without any more interruption.</p>
<p>First, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is
this;&mdash;that from the specimens of singularity in my father's
notions in the point of Christian-names, and that other previous
point thereto,&mdash;you was led, I think, into an
opinion,&mdash;(and I am sure I said as much) that my father was a
gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions.
In truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very
first act of his begetting,&mdash;down to the lean and slippered
pantaloon in his second childishness, but he had some favourite
notion to himself, springing out of it, as sceptical, and as far
out of the high-way of thinking, as these two which have been
explained.</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. Shandy, my father, Sir, would see nothing in the
light in which others placed it;&mdash;he placed things in his own
light;&mdash;he would weigh nothing in common scales;&mdash;no, he
was too refined a researcher to lie open to so gross an
imposition.&mdash;To come at the exact weight of things in the
scientific steel-yard, the fulcrum, he would say, should be almost
invisible, to avoid all friction from popular tenets;&mdash;without
this the minutiae of philosophy, which would always turn the
balance, will have no weight at all. Knowledge, like matter, he
would affirm, was divisible in infinitum;&mdash;that the grains and
scruples were as much a part of it, as the gravitation of the whole
world.&mdash;In a word, he would say, error was error,&mdash;no
matter where it fell,&mdash;whether in a fraction,&mdash;or a
pound,&mdash;'twas alike fatal to truth, and she was kept down at
the bottom of her well, as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a
butterfly's wing,&mdash;as in the disk of the sun, the moon, and
all the stars of heaven put together.</p>
<p>He would often lament that it was for want of considering this
properly, and of applying it skilfully to civil matters, as well as
to speculative truths, that so many things in this world were out
of joint;&mdash;that the political arch was giving way;&mdash;and
that the very foundations of our excellent constitution in church
and state, were so sapped as estimators had reported.</p>
<p>You cry out, he would say, we are a ruined, undone people. Why?
he would ask, making use of the sorites or syllogism of Zeno and
Chrysippus, without knowing it belonged to them.&mdash;Why? why are
we a ruined people?&mdash;Because we are corrupted.&mdash;Whence is
it, dear Sir, that we are corrupted?&mdash;Because we are
needy;&mdash;our poverty, and not our wills, consent.&mdash;And
wherefore, he would add, are we needy?&mdash;From the neglect, he
would answer, of our pence and our halfpence:&mdash;Our bank notes,
Sir, our guineas,&mdash;nay our shillings take care of
themselves.</p>
<p>'Tis the same, he would say, throughout the whole circle of the
sciences;&mdash;the great, the established points of them, are not
to be broke in upon.&mdash;The laws of nature will defend
themselves;&mdash;but error&mdash;(he would add, looking earnestly
at my mother)&mdash;error, Sir, creeps in thro' the minute holes
and small crevices which human nature leaves unguarded.</p>
<p>This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you
of:&mdash;The point you are to be informed of, and which I have
reserved for this place, is as follows.</p>
<p>Amongst the many and excellent reasons, with which my father had
urged my mother to accept of Dr. Slop's assistance preferably to
that of the old woman,&mdash;there was one of a very singular
nature; which, when he had done arguing the matter with her as a
Christian, and came to argue it over again with her as a
philosopher, he had put his whole strength to, depending indeed
upon it as his sheet-anchor.&mdash;It failed him, tho' from no
defect in the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was
not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of
it.&mdash;Cursed luck!&mdash;said he to himself, one afternoon, as
he walked out of the room, after he had been stating it for an hour
and a half to her, to no manner of purpose;&mdash;cursed luck! said
he, biting his lip as he shut the door,&mdash;for a man to be
master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in
nature,&mdash;and have a wife at the same time with such a
head-piece, that he cannot hang up a single inference within side
of it, to save his soul from destruction.</p>
<p>This argument, though it was entirely lost upon my
mother,&mdash;had more weight with him, than all his other
arguments joined together:&mdash;I will therefore endeavour to do
it justice,&mdash;and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am
master of.</p>
<p>My father set out upon the strength of these two following
axioms:</p>
<p>First, That an ounce of a man's own wit, was worth a ton of
other people's; and,</p>
<p>Secondly, (Which by the bye, was the ground-work of the first
axiom,&mdash;tho' it comes last) That every man's wit must come
from every man's own soul,&mdash;and no other body's.</p>
<p>Now, as it was plain to my father, that all souls were by nature
equal,&mdash;and that the great difference between the most acute
and the most obtuse understanding&mdash;was from no original
sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below
another,&mdash;but arose merely from the lucky or unlucky
organization of the body, in that part where the soul principally
took up her residence,&mdash;he had made it the subject of his
enquiry to find out the identical place.</p>
<p>Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this
matter, he was satisfied it could not be where Des Cartes had fixed
it, upon the top of the pineal gland of the brain; which, as he
philosophized, formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow
pea; tho' to speak the truth, as so many nerves did terminate all
in that one place,&mdash;'twas no bad conjecture;&mdash;and my
father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into
the centre of the mistake, had it not been for my uncle Toby, who
rescued him out of it, by a story he told him of a Walloon officer
at the battle of Landen, who had one part of his brain shot away by
a musket-ball,&mdash;and another part of it taken out after by a
French surgeon; and after all, recovered, and did his duty very
well without it.</p>
<p>If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but
the separation of the soul from the body;&mdash;and if it is true
that people can walk about and do their business without
brains,&mdash;then certes the soul does not inhabit there.
Q.E.D.</p>
<p>As for that certain, very thin, subtle and very fragrant juice
which Coglionissimo Borri, the great Milaneze physician affirms, in
a letter to Bartholine, to have discovered in the cellulae of the
occipital parts of the cerebellum, and which he likewise affirms to
be the principal seat of the reasonable soul, (for, you must know,
in these latter and more enlightened ages, there are two souls in
every man living,&mdash;the one, according to the great
Metheglingius, being called the Animus, the other, the
Anima;)&mdash;as for the opinion, I say of Borri,&mdash;my father
could never subscribe to it by any means; the very idea of so
noble, so refined, so immaterial, and so exalted a being as the
Anima, or even the Animus, taking up her residence, and sitting
dabbling, like a tad-pole all day long, both summer and winter, in
a puddle,&mdash;or in a liquid of any kind, how thick or thin
soever, he would say, shocked his imagination; he would scarce give
the doctrine a hearing.</p>
<p>What, therefore, seemed the least liable to objections of any,
was that the chief sensorium, or head-quarters of the soul, and to
which place all intelligences were referred, and from whence all
her mandates were issued,&mdash;was in, or near, the
cerebellum,&mdash;or rather somewhere about the medulla oblongata,
wherein it was generally agreed by Dutch anatomists, that all the
minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered,
like streets and winding alleys, into a square.</p>
<p>So far there was nothing singular in my father's
opinion,&mdash;he had the best of philosophers, of all ages and
climates, to go along with him.&mdash;But here he took a road of
his own, setting up another Shandean hypothesis upon these
corner-stones they had laid for him;&mdash;and which said
hypothesis equally stood its ground; whether the subtilty and
fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness of
the said liquor, or of the finer net-work and texture in the
cerebellum itself; which opinion he favoured.</p>
<p>He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act
of propagation of each individual, which required all the thought
in the world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible
contexture, in which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is
usually meant by the name of good natural parts, do
consist;&mdash;that next to this and his Christian-name, which were
the two original and most efficacious causes of all;&mdash;that the
third cause, or rather what logicians call the Causa sina qua non,
and without which all that was done was of no manner of
significance,&mdash;was the preservation of this delicate and
fine-spun web, from the havock which was generally made in it by
the violent compression and crush which the head was made to
undergo, by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by
that foremost.</p>
<p>&mdash;This requires explanation.</p>
<p>My father, who dipped into all kinds of books, upon looking into
Lithopaedus Senonesis de Portu difficili, (The author is here twice
mistaken; for Lithopaedus should be wrote thus, Lithopaedii
Senonensis Icon. The second mistake is, that this Lithopaedus is
not an author, but a drawing of a petrified child. The account of
this, published by Athosius 1580, may be seen at the end of
Cordaeus's works in Spachius. Mr. Tristram Shandy has been led into
this error, either from seeing Lithopaedus's name of late in a
catalogue of learned writers in Dr..., or by mistaking Lithopaedus
for Trinecavellius,&mdash;from the too great similitude of the
names.) published by Adrianus Smelvgot, had found out, that the lax
and pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the bones of
the cranium having no sutures at that time, was such,&mdash;that by
force of the woman's efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was
equal, upon an average, to the weight of 470 pounds avoirdupois
acting perpendicularly upon it;&mdash;it so happened, that in 49
instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and moulded into
the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a
pastry-cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye
of.&mdash;Good God! cried my father, what havock and destruction
must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the
cerebellum!&mdash;Or if there is such a juice as Borri
pretends&mdash;is it not enough to make the clearest liquid in the
world both seculent and mothery?</p>
<p>But how great was his apprehension, when he farther understood,
that this force acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only
injured the brain itself, or cerebrum,&mdash;but that it
necessarily squeezed and propelled the cerebrum towards the
cerebellum, which was the immediate seat of the
understanding!&mdash;Angels and ministers of grace defend us! cried
my father,&mdash;can any soul withstand this shock?&mdash;No wonder
the intellectual web is so rent and tattered as we see it; and that
so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of
silk,&mdash;all perplexity,&mdash;all confusion within-side.</p>
<p>But when my father read on, and was let into the secret, that
when a child was turned topsy-turvy, which was easy for an operator
to do, and was extracted by the feet;&mdash;that instead of the
cerebrum being propelled towards the cerebellum, the cerebellum, on
the contrary, was propelled simply towards the cerebrum, where it
could do no manner of hurt:&mdash;By heavens! cried he, the world
is in conspiracy to drive out what little wit God has given
us,&mdash;and the professors of the obstetric art are listed into
the same conspiracy.&mdash;What is it to me which end of my son
comes foremost into the world, provided all goes right after, and
his cerebellum escapes uncrushed?</p>
<p>It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived
it, that it assimilates every thing to itself, as proper
nourishment; and, from the first moment of your begetting it, it
generally grows the stronger by every thing you see, hear, read, or
understand. This is of great use.</p>
<p>When my father was gone with this about a month, there was
scarce a phaenomenon of stupidity or of genius, which he could not
readily solve by it;&mdash;it accounted for the eldest son being
the greatest blockhead in the family.&mdash;Poor devil, he would
say,&mdash;he made way for the capacity of his younger
brothers.&mdash;It unriddled the observations of drivellers and
monstrous heads,&mdash;shewing a priori, it could not be
otherwise,&mdash;unless... I don't know what. It wonderfully
explained and accounted for the acumen of the Asiatic genius, and
that sprightlier turn, and a more penetrating intuition of minds,
in warmer climates; not from the loose and common-place solution of
a clearer sky, and a more perpetual sunshine, &amp;c.&mdash;which
for aught he knew, might as well rarefy and dilute the faculties of
the soul into nothing, by one extreme,&mdash;as they are condensed
in colder climates by the other;&mdash;but he traced the affair up
to its spring-head;&mdash;shewed that, in warmer climates, nature
had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the
creation;&mdash;their pleasures more;&mdash;the necessity of their
pains less, insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the
vertex was so slight, that the whole organization of the cerebellum
was preserved;&mdash;nay, he did not believe, in natural births,
that so much as a single thread of the net-work was broke or
displaced,&mdash;so that the soul might just act as she liked.</p>
<p>When my father had got so far,&mdash;what a blaze of light did
the accounts of the Caesarian section, and of the towering geniuses
who had come safe into the world by it, cast upon this hypothesis?
Here you see, he would say, there was no injury done to the
sensorium;&mdash;no pressure of the head against the
pelvis;&mdash;no propulsion of the cerebrum towards the cerebellum,
either by the os pubis on this side, or os coxygis on
that;&mdash;and pray, what were the happy consequences? Why, Sir,
your Julius Caesar, who gave the operation a name;&mdash;and your
Hermes Trismegistus, who was born so before ever the operation had
a name;&mdash;your Scipio Africanus; your Manlius Torquatus; our
Edward the Sixth,&mdash;who, had he lived, would have done the same
honour to the hypothesis:&mdash;These, and many more who figured
high in the annals of fame,&mdash;all came side-way, Sir, into the
world.</p>
<p>The incision of the abdomen and uterus ran for six weeks
together in my father's head;&mdash;he had read, and was satisfied,
that wounds in the epigastrium, and those in the matrix, were not
mortal;&mdash;so that the belly of the mother might be opened
extremely well to give a passage to the child.&mdash;He mentioned
the thing one afternoon to my mother,&mdash;merely as a matter of
fact; but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of
it, as much as the operation flattered his hopes,&mdash;he thought
it as well to say no more of it,&mdash;contenting himself with
admiring,&mdash;what he thought was to no purpose to propose.</p>
<p>This was my father Mr. Shandy's hypothesis; concerning which I
have only to add, that my brother Bobby did as great honour to it
(whatever he did to the family) as any one of the great heroes we
spoke of: For happening not only to be christened, as I told you,
but to be born too, when my father was at Epsom,&mdash;being
moreover my mother's first child,&mdash;coming into the world with
his head foremost,&mdash;and turning out afterwards a lad of
wonderful slow parts,&mdash;my father spelt all these together into
his opinion: and as he had failed at one end,&mdash;he was
determined to try the other.</p>
<p>This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are
not easily to be put out of their way,&mdash;and was therefore one
of my father's great reasons in favour of a man of science, whom he
could better deal with.</p>
<p>Of all men in the world, Dr. Slop was the fittest for my
father's purpose;&mdash;for though this new-invented forceps was
the armour he had proved, and what he maintained to be the safest
instrument of deliverance, yet, it seems, he had scattered a word
or two in his book, in favour of the very thing which ran in my
father's fancy;&mdash;tho' not with a view to the soul's good in
extracting by the feet, as was my father's system,&mdash;but for
reasons merely obstetrical.</p>
<p>This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr.
Slop, in the ensuing discourse, which went a little hard against my
uncle Toby.&mdash;In what manner a plain man, with nothing but
common sense, could bear up against two such allies in
science,&mdash;is hard to conceive.&mdash;You may conjecture upon
it, if you please,&mdash;and whilst your imagination is in motion,
you may encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes and
effects in nature it could come to pass, that my uncle Toby got his
modesty by the wound he received upon his groin.&mdash;You may
raise a system to account for the loss of my nose by
marriage-articles,&mdash;and shew the world how it could happen,
that I should have the misfortune to be called Tristram, in
opposition to my father's hypothesis, and the wish of the whole
family, Godfathers and Godmothers not excepted.&mdash;These, with
fifty other points left yet unravelled, you may endeavour to solve
if you have time;&mdash;but I tell you beforehand it will be in
vain, for not the sage Alquise, the magician in Don Belianis of
Greece, nor the no less famous Urganda, the sorceress his wife,
(were they alive) could pretend to come within a league of the
truth.</p>
<p>The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of
these matters till the next year,&mdash;when a series of things
will be laid open which he little expects.</p>

<p>&mdash;'I wish, Dr. Slop,' quoth my uncle Toby, (repeating his
wish for Dr. Slop a second time, and with a degree of more zeal and
earnestness in his manner of wishing, than he had wished at first
(Vide.))&mdash;'I wish, Dr. Slop,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'you had
seen what prodigious armies we had in Flanders.'</p>
<p>My uncle Toby's wish did Dr. Slop a disservice which his heart
never intended any man,&mdash;Sir, it confounded him&mdash;and
thereby putting his ideas first into confusion, and then to flight,
he could not rally them again for the soul of him.</p>
<p>In all disputes,&mdash;male or female,&mdash;whether for honour,
for profit, or for love,&mdash;it makes no difference in the
case;&mdash;nothing is more dangerous, Madam, than a wish coming
sideways in this unexpected manner upon a man: the safest way in
general to take off the force of the wish, is for the party wish'd
at, instantly to get upon his legs&mdash;and wish the wisher
something in return, of pretty near the same value,&mdash;so
balancing the account upon the spot, you stand as you
were&mdash;nay sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by
it.</p>
<p>This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of
wishes.&mdash;</p>
<p>Dr. Slop did not understand the nature of this defence;&mdash;he
was puzzled with it, and it put an entire stop to the dispute for
four minutes and a half;&mdash;five had been fatal to it:&mdash;my
father saw the danger&mdash;the dispute was one of the most
interesting disputes in the world, 'Whether the child of his
prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or with
one:'&mdash;he waited to the last moment, to allow Dr. Slop, in
whose behalf the wish was made, his right of returning it; but
perceiving, I say, that he was confounded, and continued looking
with that perplexed vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally
stare with&mdash;first in my uncle Toby's face&mdash;then in
his&mdash;then up&mdash;then down&mdash;then east&mdash;east and by
east, and so on,&mdash;coasting it along by the plinth of the
wainscot till he had got to the opposite point of the
compass,&mdash;and that he had actually begun to count the brass
nails upon the arm of his chair,&mdash;my father thought there was
no time to be lost with my uncle Toby, so took up the discourse as
follows.</p>

<h3>'&mdash;What prodigious armies you had in
Flanders!'&mdash;</h3>
<p>Brother Toby, replied my father, taking his wig from off his
head with his right hand, and with his left pulling out a striped
India handkerchief from his right coat pocket, in order to rub his
head, as he argued the point with my uncle Toby.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Now, in this I think my father was much to blame; and I
will give you my reasons for it.</p>
<p>Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than,
'Whether my father should have taken off his wig with his right
hand or with his left,'&mdash;have divided the greatest kingdoms,
and made the crowns of the monarchs who governed them, to totter
upon their heads.&mdash;But need I tell you, Sir, that the
circumstances with which every thing in this world is begirt, give
every thing in this world its size and shape!&mdash;and by
tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to
be, what it
is&mdash;great&mdash;little&mdash;good&mdash;bad&mdash;indifferent
or not indifferent, just as the case happens?</p>
<p>As my father's India handkerchief was in his right coat pocket,
he should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got
engaged: on the contrary, instead of taking off his wig with it, as
he did, he ought to have committed that entirely to the left; and
then, when the natural exigency my father was under of rubbing his
head, called out for his handkerchief, he would have had nothing in
the world to have done, but to have put his right hand into his
right coat pocket and taken it out;&mdash;which he might have done
without any violence, or the least ungraceful twist in any one
tendon or muscle of his whole body.</p>
<p>In this case, (unless, indeed, my father had been resolved to
make a fool of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left
hand&mdash;or by making some nonsensical angle or other at his
elbow-joint, or armpit)&mdash;his whole attitude had been
easy&mdash;natural&mdash;unforced: Reynolds himself, as great and
gracefully as he paints, might have painted him as he sat.</p>
<p>Now as my father managed this matter,&mdash;consider what a
devil of a figure my father made of himself.</p>
<p>In the latter end of Queen Anne's reign, and in the beginning of
the reign of King George the first&mdash;'Coat pockets were cut
very low down in the skirt.'&mdash;I need say no more&mdash;the
father of mischief, had he been hammering at it a month, could not
have contrived a worse fashion for one in my father's
situation.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter in any king's reign (unless you were
as lean a subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally,
quite across your whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your
opposite coat pocket.&mdash;In the year one thousand seven hundred
and eighteen, when this happened, it was extremely difficult; so
that when my uncle Toby discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my
father's approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his mind
those he had done duty in, before the gate of St.
Nicolas;&mdash;the idea of which drew off his attention so intirely
from the subject in debate, that he had got his right hand to the
bell to ring up Trim to go and fetch his map of Namur, and his
compasses and sector along with it, to measure the returning angles
of the traverses of that attack,&mdash;but particularly of that
one, where he received his wound upon his groin.</p>
<p>My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in
his body seemed to rush up into his face&mdash;my uncle Toby
dismounted immediately.</p>

<p>A man's body and his mind, with the utmost reverence to both I
speak it, are exactly like a jerkin, and a jerkin's
lining;&mdash;rumple the one,&mdash;you rumple the other. There is
one certain exception however in this case, and that is, when you
are so fortunate a fellow, as to have had your jerkin made of
gum-taffeta, and the body-lining to it of a sarcenet, or thin
persian.</p>
<p>Zeno, Cleanthes, Diogenes Babylonius, Dionysius, Heracleotes,
Antipater, Panaetius, and Possidonius amongst the
Greeks;&mdash;Cato and Varro and Seneca amongst the
Romans;&mdash;Pantenus and Clemens Alexandrinus and Montaigne
amongst the Christians; and a score and a half of good, honest,
unthinking Shandean people as ever lived, whose names I can't
recollect,&mdash;all pretended that their jerkins were made after
this fashion,&mdash;you might have rumpled and crumpled, and
doubled and creased, and fretted and fridged the outside of them
all to pieces;&mdash;in short, you might have played the very devil
with them, and at the same time, not one of the insides of them
would have been one button the worse, for all you had done to
them.</p>
<p>I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after
this sort:&mdash;for never poor jerkin has been tickled off at such
a rate as it has been these last nine months together,&mdash;and
yet I declare, the lining to it,&mdash;as far as I am a judge of
the matter,&mdash;is not a three-penny piece the
worse;&mdash;pell-mell, helter-skelter, ding-dong, cut and thrust,
back stroke and fore stroke, side way and long-way, have they been
trimming it for me:&mdash;had there been the least gumminess in my
lining,&mdash;by heaven! it had all of it long ago been frayed and
fretted to a thread.</p>
<p>&mdash;You Messrs. the Monthly Reviewers!&mdash;how could you
cut and slash my jerkin as you did?&mdash;how did you know but you
would cut my lining too?</p>
<p>Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who
will injure none of us, do I recommend you and your
affairs,&mdash;so God bless you;&mdash;only next month, if any one
of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at me, as some of
you did last May (in which I remember the weather was very
hot)&mdash;don't be exasperated, if I pass it by again with good
temper,&mdash;(being determined as long as I live or write) which
in my case means the same thing) never to give the honest gentleman
a worse word or a worse wish than my uncle Toby gave the fly which
buzz'd about his nose all dinner-time,&mdash;'Go,&mdash;go, poor

scientifically speaking, six whole tints and a half, if not a full
octave above his natural colour:&mdash;any man, Madam, but my uncle
Toby, who had observed this, together with the violent knitting of
my father's brows, and the extravagant contortion of his body
during the whole affair,&mdash;would have concluded my father in a
rage; and taking that for granted,&mdash;had he been a lover of
such kind of concord as arises from two such instruments being put

<h3>'What prodigious armies you had in Flanders!'</h3>
<p>&mdash;Brother Toby, quoth my father, I do believe thee to be as
honest a man, and with as good and as upright a heart as ever God
created;&mdash;nor is it thy fault, if all the children which have
been, may, can, shall, will, or ought to be begotten, come with
their heads foremost into the world:&mdash;but believe me, dear
Toby, the accidents which unavoidably way-lay them, not only in the
article of our begetting 'em&mdash;though these, in my opinion, are
well worth considering,&mdash;but the dangers and difficulties our
children are beset with, after they are got forth into the world,
are enow&mdash;little need is there to expose them to unnecessary
ones in their passage to it.&mdash;Are these dangers, quoth my
uncle Toby, laying his hand upon my father's knee, and looking up
seriously in his face for an answer,&mdash;are these dangers
greater now o'days, brother, than in times past? Brother Toby,
answered my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born
alive, and healthy, and the mother did well after it,&mdash;our
forefathers never looked farther.&mdash;My uncle Toby instantly
withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his body
gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see
the cornice of the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles
along his cheeks, and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do
their duty&mdash;he whistled Lillabullero.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.LI.</h2>
<p>Whilst my uncle Toby was whistling Lillabullero to my
father,&mdash;Dr. Slop was stamping, and cursing and damning at
Obadiah at a most dreadful rate,&mdash;it would have done your
heart good, and cured you, Sir, for ever of the vile sin of
swearing, to have heard him, I am determined therefore to relate
the whole affair to you.</p>
<p>When Dr. Slop's maid delivered the green baize bag with her
master's instruments in it, to Obadiah, she very sensibly exhorted
him to put his head and one arm through the strings, and ride with
it slung across his body: so undoing the bow-knot, to lengthen the
strings for him, without any more ado, she helped him on with it.
However, as this, in some measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag,
lest any thing should bolt out in galloping back, at the speed
Obadiah threatened, they consulted to take it off again: and in the
great care and caution of their hearts, they had taken the two
strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth of the bag first)
with half a dozen hard knots, each of which Obadiah, to make all
safe, had twitched and drawn together with all the strength of his
body.</p>
<p>This answered all that Obadiah and the maid intended; but was no
remedy against some evils which neither he or she foresaw. The
instruments, it seems, as tight as the bag was tied above, had so
much room to play in it, towards the bottom (the shape of the bag
being conical) that Obadiah could not make a trot of it, but with
such a terrible jingle, what with the tire tete, forceps, and
squirt, as would have been enough, had Hymen been taking a jaunt
that way, to have frightened him out of the country; but when
Obadiah accelerated his motion, and from a plain trot assayed to
prick his coach-horse into a full gallop&mdash;by Heaven! Sir, the
jingle was incredible.</p>
<p>As Obadiah had a wife and three children&mdash;the turpitude of
fornication, and the many other political ill consequences of this
jingling, never once entered his brain,&mdash;he had however his
objection, which came home to himself, and weighed with him, as it
has oft-times done with the greatest patriots.&mdash;'The poor
fellow, Sir, was not able to hear himself whistle.'</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.LII.</h2>
<p>As Obadiah loved wind-music preferably to all the instrumental
music he carried with him,&mdash;he very considerately set his
imagination to work, to contrive and to invent by what means he
should put himself in a condition of enjoying it.</p>
<p>In all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted,
nothing is so apt to enter a man's head as his hat-band:&mdash;the
philosophy of this is so near the surface&mdash;I scorn to enter
into it.</p>
<p>As Obadiah's was a mixed case&mdash;mark, Sirs,&mdash;I say, a
mixed case; for it was obstetrical,&mdash;scrip-tical, squirtical,
papistical&mdash;and as far as the coach-horse was concerned in
it,&mdash;caballistical&mdash;and only partly
musical;&mdash;Obadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the
first expedient which offered; so taking hold of the bag and
instruments, and griping them hard together with one hand, and with
the finger and thumb of the other putting the end of the hat-band
betwixt his teeth, and then slipping his hand down to the middle of
it,&mdash;he tied and cross-tied them all fast together from one
end to the other (as you would cord a trunk) with such a
multiplicity of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with a hard
knot at every intersection or point where the strings
met,&mdash;that Dr. Slop must have had three fifths of Job's
patience at least to have unloosed them.&mdash;I think in my
conscience, that had Nature been in one of her nimble moods, and in
humour for such a contest&mdash;and she and Dr. Slop both fairly
started together&mdash;there is no man living which had seen the
bag with all that Obadiah had done to it,&mdash;and known likewise
the great speed the Goddess can make when she thinks proper, who
would have had the least doubt remaining in his mind&mdash;which of
the two would have carried off the prize. My mother, Madam, had
been delivered sooner than the green bag infallibly&mdash;at least
by twenty knots.&mdash;Sport of small accidents, Tristram Shandy!
that thou art, and ever will be! had that trial been for thee, and
it was fifty to one but it had,&mdash;thy affairs had not been so
depress'd&mdash;(at least by the depression of thy nose) as they
have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions of
making them, which have so often presented themselves in the course
of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so tamely, so
irrecoverably abandoned&mdash;as thou hast been forced to leave
them;&mdash;but 'tis over,&mdash;all but the account of 'em, which
cannot be given to the curious till I am got out into the
world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.I.</h2>
<p>Great wits jump: for the moment Dr. Slop cast his eyes upon his
bag (which he had not done till the dispute with my uncle Toby
about mid-wifery put him in mind of it)&mdash;the very same thought
occurred.&mdash;'Tis God's mercy, quoth he (to himself) that Mrs.
Shandy has had so bad a time of it,&mdash;else she might have been
brought to bed seven times told, before one half of these knots
could have got untied.&mdash;But here you must
distinguish&mdash;the thought floated only in Dr. Slop's mind,
without sail or ballast to it, as a simple proposition; millions of
which, as your worship knows, are every day swimming quietly in the
middle of the thin juice of a man's understanding, without being
carried backwards or forwards, till some little gusts of passion or
interest drive them to one side.</p>
<p>A sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother's bed, did
the proposition the very service I am speaking of. By all that's
unfortunate, quoth Dr. Slop, unless I make haste, the thing will
actually befall me as it is.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.II.</h2>
<p>In the case of knots,&mdash;by which, in the first place, I
would not be understood to mean slip-knots&mdash;because in the
course of my life and opinions&mdash;my opinions concerning them
will come in more properly when I mention the catastrophe of my
great uncle Mr. Hammond Shandy,&mdash;a little man,&mdash;but of
high fancy:&mdash;he rushed into the duke of Monmouth's
affair:&mdash;nor, secondly, in this place, do I mean that
particular species of knots called bow-knots;&mdash;there is so
little address, or skill, or patience required in the unloosing
them, that they are below my giving any opinion at all about
them.&mdash;But by the knots I am speaking of, may it please your
reverences to believe, that I mean good, honest, devilish tight,
hard knots, made bona fide, as Obadiah made his;&mdash;in which
there is no quibbling provision made by the duplication and return
of the two ends of the strings thro' the annulus or noose made by
the second implication of them&mdash;to get them slipp'd and undone
by.&mdash;I hope you apprehend me.</p>
<p>In the case of these knots then, and of the several
obstructions, which, may it please your reverences, such knots cast
in our way in getting through life&mdash;every hasty man can whip
out his pen-knife and cut through them.&mdash;'Tis wrong. Believe
me, Sirs, the most virtuous way, and which both reason and
conscience dictate&mdash;is to take our teeth or our fingers to
them.&mdash;Dr. Slop had lost his teeth&mdash;his favourite
instrument, by extracting in a wrong direction, or by some
misapplication of it, unfortunately slipping, he had formerly, in a
hard labour, knock'd out three of the best of them with the handle
of it:&mdash;he tried his fingers&mdash;alas; the nails of his
fingers and thumbs were cut close.&mdash;The duce take it! I can
make nothing of it either way, cried Dr. Slop.&mdash;The trampling
over head near my mother's bed-side increased.&mdash;Pox take the
fellow! I shall never get the knots untied as long as I
live.&mdash;My mother gave a groan.&mdash;Lend me your
penknife&mdash;I must e'en cut the knots at
last&mdash;pugh!&mdash;psha!&mdash;Lord! I have cut my thumb quite
across to the very bone&mdash;curse the fellow&mdash;if there was
not another man-midwife within fifty miles&mdash;I am undone for
this bout&mdash;I wish the scoundrel hang'd&mdash;I wish he was
shot&mdash;I wish all the devils in hell had him for a
blockhead&mdash;!</p>
<p>My father had a great respect for Obadiah, and could not bear to
hear him disposed of in such a manner&mdash;he had moreover some
little respect for himself&mdash;and could as ill bear with the
indignity offered to himself in it.</p>
<p>Had Dr. Slop cut any part about him, but his thumb&mdash;my
father had pass'd it by&mdash;his prudence had triumphed: as it
was, he was determined to have his revenge.</p>
<p>Small curses, Dr. Slop, upon great occasions, quoth my father
(condoling with him first upon the accident) are but so much waste
of our strength and soul's health to no manner of purpose.&mdash;I
own it, replied Dr. Slop.&mdash;They are like sparrow-shot, quoth
my uncle Toby (suspending his whistling) fired against a
bastion.&mdash;They serve, continued my father, to stir the
humours&mdash;but carry off none of their acrimony:&mdash;for my
own part, I seldom swear or curse at all&mdash;I hold it
bad&mdash;but if I fall into it by surprize, I generally retain so
much presence of mind (right, quoth my uncle Toby) as to make it
answer my purpose&mdash;that is, I swear on till I find myself
easy. A wife and a just man however would always endeavour to
proportion the vent given to these humours, not only to the degree
of them stirring within himself&mdash;but to the size and ill
intent of the offence upon which they are to fall.&mdash;'Injuries
come only from the heart,'&mdash;quoth my uncle Toby. For this
reason, continued my father, with the most Cervantick gravity, I
have the greatest veneration in the world for that gentleman, who,
in distrust of his own discretion in this point, sat down and
composed (that is at his leisure) fit forms of swearing suitable to
all cases, from the lowest to the highest provocation which could
possibly happen to him&mdash;which forms being well considered by
him, and such moreover as he could stand to, he kept them ever by
him on the chimney-piece, within his reach, ready for use.&mdash;I
never apprehended, replied Dr. Slop, that such a thing was ever
thought of&mdash;much less executed. I beg your pardon, answered my
father; I was reading, though not using, one of them to my brother
Toby this morning, whilst he pour'd out the tea&mdash;'tis here
upon the shelf over my head;&mdash;but if I remember right, 'tis
too violent for a cut of the thumb.&mdash;Not at all, quoth Dr.
Slop&mdash;the devil take the fellow.&mdash;Then, answered my
father, 'Tis much at your service, Dr. Slop&mdash;on condition you
will read it aloud;&mdash;so rising up and reaching down a form of
excommunication of the church of Rome, a copy of which, my father
(who was curious in his collections) had procured out of the
leger-book of the church of Rochester, writ by Ernulphus the
bishop&mdash;with a most affected seriousness of look and voice,
which might have cajoled Ernulphus himself&mdash;he put it into Dr.
Slop's hands.&mdash;Dr. Slop wrapt his thumb up in the corner of
his handkerchief, and with a wry face, though without any
suspicion, read aloud, as follows&mdash;my uncle Toby whistling
Lillabullero as loud as he could all the time.</p>
<p>(As the geniuneness of the consultation of the Sorbonne upon the
question of baptism, was doubted by some, and denied by
others&mdash;'twas thought proper to print the original of this
excommunication; for the copy of which Mr. Shandy returns thanks to
the chapter clerk of the dean and chapter of Rochester.)</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.IV.</h2>
<p>'By the authority of God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and of the holy canons, and of the undefiled Virgin Mary,
mother and patroness of our Saviour.' I think there is no
necessity, quoth Dr. Slop, dropping the paper down to his knee, and
addressing himself to my father&mdash;as you have read it over,
Sir, so lately, to read it aloud&mdash;and as Captain Shandy seems
to have no great inclination to hear it&mdash;I may as well read it
to myself. That's contrary to treaty, replied my
father:&mdash;besides, there is something so whimsical, especially
in the latter part of it, I should grieve to lose the pleasure of a
second reading. Dr. Slop did not altogether like it,&mdash;but my
uncle Toby offering at that instant to give over whistling, and
read it himself to them;&mdash;Dr. Slop thought he might as well
read it under the cover of my uncle Toby's whistling&mdash;as
suffer my uncle Toby to read it alone;&mdash;so raising up the
paper to his face, and holding it quite parallel to it, in order to
hide his chagrin&mdash;he read it aloud as follows&mdash;my uncle
Toby whistling Lillabullero, though not quite so loud as
before.</p>
<p>'By the authority of God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and of the undefiled Virgin Mary, mother and patroness of
our Saviour, and of all the celestial virtues, angels, archangels,
thrones, dominions, powers, cherubins and seraphins, and of all the
holy patriarchs, prophets, and of all the apostles and evangelists,
and of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the Holy Lamb, are
found worthy to sing the new song of the holy martyrs and holy
confessors, and of the holy virgins, and of all the saints
together, with the holy and elect of God,&mdash;May he' (Obadiah)
'be damn'd' (for tying these knots)&mdash;'We excommunicate, and
anathematize him, and from the thresholds of the holy church of God
Almighty we sequester him, that he may be tormented, disposed, and
delivered over with Dathan and Abiram, and with those who say unto
the Lord God, Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways. And as
fire is quenched with water, so let the light of him be put out for
evermore, unless it shall repent him' (Obadiah, of the knots which
he has tied) 'and make satisfaction' (for them) 'Amen.</p>
<p>'May the Father who created man, curse him.&mdash;May the Son
who suffered for us curse him.&mdash;May the Holy Ghost, who was
given to us in baptism, curse him' (Obadiah)&mdash;'May the holy
cross which Christ, for our salvation triumphing over his enemies,
ascended, curse him.</p>
<p>'May the holy and eternal Virgin Mary, mother of God, curse
him.&mdash;May St. Michael, the advocate of holy souls, curse
him.&mdash;May all the angels and archangels, principalities and
powers, and all the heavenly armies, curse him.' (Our armies swore
terribly in Flanders, cried my uncle Toby,&mdash;but nothing to
this.&mdash;For my own part I could not have a heart to curse my
dog so.)</p>
<p>'May St. John, the Praecursor, and St. John the Baptist, and St.
Peter and St. Paul, and St. Andrew, and all other Christ's
apostles, together curse him. And may the rest of his disciples and
four evangelists, who by their preaching converted the universal
world, and may the holy and wonderful company of martyrs and
confessors who by their holy works are found pleasing to God
Almighty, curse him' (Obadiah.)</p>
<p>'May the holy choir of the holy virgins, who for the honour of
Christ have despised the things of the world, damn him&mdash;May
all the saints, who from the beginning of the world to everlasting
ages are found to be beloved of God, damn him&mdash;May the heavens
and earth, and all the holy things remaining therein, damn him,'
(Obadiah) 'or her,' (or whoever else had a hand in tying these
knots.)</p>
<p>'May he (Obadiah) be damn'd wherever he be&mdash;whether in the
house or the stables, the garden or the field, or the highway, or
in the path, or in the wood, or in the water, or in the
church.&mdash;May he be cursed in living, in dying.' (Here my uncle
Toby, taking the advantage of a minim in the second bar of his
tune, kept whistling one continued note to the end of the
sentence.&mdash;Dr. Slop, with his division of curses moving under
him, like a running bass all the way.) 'May he be cursed in eating
and drinking, in being hungry, in being thirsty, in fasting, in
sleeping, in slumbering, in walking, in standing, in sitting, in
lying, in working, in resting, in pissing, in shitting, and in
blood-letting!</p>
<p>'May he' (Obadiah) 'be cursed in all the faculties of his
body!</p>
<p>'May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly!&mdash;May he be cursed
in the hair of his head!&mdash;May he be cursed in his brains, and
in his vertex,' (that is a sad curse, quoth my father) 'in his
temples, in his forehead, in his ears, in his eye-brows, in his
cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his fore-teeth and
grinders, in his lips, in his throat, in his shoulders, in his
wrists, in his arms, in his hands, in his fingers!</p>
<p>'May he be damn'd in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart and
purtenance, down to the very stomach!</p>
<p>'May he be cursed in his reins, and in his groin,' (God in
heaven forbid! quoth my uncle Toby) 'in his thighs, in his
genitals,' (my father shook his head) 'and in his hips, and in his
knees, his legs, and feet, and toe-nails!</p>
<p>'May he be cursed in all the joints and articulations of the
members, from the top of his head to the sole of his foot! May
there be no soundness in him!</p>
<p>'May the son of the living God, with all the glory of his
Majesty'&mdash;(Here my uncle Toby, throwing back his head, gave a
monstrous, long, loud Whew&mdash;w&mdash;w&mdash;something betwixt
the interjectional whistle of Hay-day! and the word
itself.)&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;By the golden beard of Jupiter&mdash;and of Juno (if her
majesty wore one) and by the beards of the rest of your heathen
worships, which by the bye was no small number, since what with the
beards of your celestial gods, and gods aerial and
aquatick&mdash;to say nothing of the beards of town-gods and
country-gods, or of the celestial goddesses your wives, or of the
infernal goddesses your whores and concubines (that is in case they
wore them)&mdash;all which beards, as Varro tells me, upon his word
and honour, when mustered up together, made no less than thirty
thousand effective beards upon the Pagan establishment;&mdash;every
beard of which claimed the rights and privileges of being stroken
and sworn by&mdash;by all these beards together then&mdash;I vow
and protest, that of the two bad cassocks I am worth in the world,
I would have given the better of them, as freely as ever Cid Hamet
offered his&mdash;to have stood by, and heard my uncle Toby's
accompanyment.</p>
<p>&mdash;'curse him!'&mdash;continued Dr. Slop,&mdash;'and may
heaven, with all the powers which move therein, rise up against
him, curse and damn him' (Obadiah) 'unless he repent and make
satisfaction! Amen. So be it,&mdash;so be it. Amen.'</p>
<p>I declare, quoth my uncle Toby, my heart would not let me curse
the devil himself with so much bitterness.&mdash;He is the father
of curses, replied Dr. Slop.&mdash;So am not I, replied my
uncle.&mdash;But he is cursed, and damn'd already, to all eternity,
replied Dr. Slop.</p>
<p>I am sorry for it, quoth my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>Dr. Slop drew up his mouth, and was just beginning to return my
uncle Toby the compliment of his Whu&mdash;u&mdash;u&mdash;or
interjectional whistle&mdash;when the door hastily opening in the
next chapter but one&mdash;put an end to the affair.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.V.</h2>
<p>Now don't let us give ourselves a parcel of airs, and pretend
that the oaths we make free with in this land of liberty of ours
are our own; and because we have the spirit to swear
them,&mdash;imagine that we have had the wit to invent them
too.</p>
<p>I'll undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the world,
except to a connoisseur:&mdash;though I declare I object only to a
connoisseur in swearing,&mdash;as I would do to a connoisseur in
painting, &amp;c. &amp;c. the whole set of 'em are so hung round
and befetish'd with the bobs and trinkets of criticism,&mdash;or to
drop my metaphor, which by the bye is a pity&mdash;for I have
fetch'd it as far as from the coast of Guiney;&mdash;their heads,
Sir, are stuck so full of rules and compasses, and have that
eternal propensity to apply them upon all occasions, that a work of
genius had better go to the devil at once, than stand to be prick'd
and tortured to death by 'em.</p>
<p>&mdash;And how did Garrick speak the soliloquy last
night?&mdash;Oh, against all rule, my lord,&mdash;most
ungrammatically! betwixt the substantive and the adjective, which
should agree together in number, case, and gender, he made a breach
thus,&mdash;stopping, as if the point wanted settling;&mdash;and
betwixt the nominative case, which your lordship knows should
govern the verb, he suspended his voice in the epilogue a dozen
times three seconds and three fifths by a stop watch, my lord, each
time.&mdash;Admirable grammarian!&mdash;But in suspending his
voice&mdash;was the sense suspended likewise? Did no expression of
attitude or countenance fill up the chasm?&mdash;Was the eye
silent? Did you narrowly look?&mdash;I look'd only at the
stop-watch, my lord.&mdash;Excellent observer!</p>
<p>And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout
about?&mdash;Oh! 'tis out of all plumb, my lord,&mdash;quite an
irregular thing!&mdash;not one of the angles at the four corners
was a right angle.&mdash;I had my rule and compasses, &amp;c. my
lord, in my pocket.&mdash;Excellent critick!</p>
<p>&mdash;And for the epick poem your lordship bid me look
at&mdash;upon taking the length, breadth, height, and depth of it,
and trying them at home upon an exact scale of Bossu's&mdash;'tis
out, my lord, in every one of its dimensions.&mdash;Admirable
connoisseur!</p>
<p>&mdash;And did you step in, to take a look at the grand picture
in your way back?&mdash;'Tis a melancholy daub! my lord; not one
principle of the pyramid in any one group!&mdash;and what a
price!&mdash;for there is nothing of the colouring of
Titian&mdash;the expression of Rubens&mdash;the grace of
Raphael&mdash;the purity of Dominichino&mdash;the corregiescity of
Corregio&mdash;the learning of Poussin&mdash;the airs of
Guido&mdash;the taste of the Carrachis&mdash;or the grand contour
of Angelo.&mdash;Grant me patience, just Heaven!&mdash;Of all the
cants which are canted in this canting world&mdash;though the cant
of hypocrites may be the worst&mdash;the cant of criticism is the
most tormenting!</p>
<p>I would go fifty miles on foot, for I have not a horse worth
riding on, to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will
give up the reins of his imagination into his author's
hands&mdash;be pleased he knows not why, and cares not
wherefore.</p>
<p>Great Apollo! if thou art in a giving humour&mdash;give
me&mdash;I ask no more, but one stroke of native humour, with a
single spark of thy own fire along with it&mdash;and send Mercury,
with the rules and compasses, if he can be spared, with my
compliments to&mdash;no matter.</p>
<p>Now to any one else I will undertake to prove, that all the
oaths and imprecations which we have been puffing off upon the
world for these two hundred and fifty years last past as
originals&mdash;except St. Paul's thumb&mdash;God's flesh and God's
fish, which were oaths monarchical, and, considering who made them,
not much amiss; and as kings oaths, 'tis not much matter whether
they were fish or flesh;&mdash;else I say, there is not an oath, or
at least a curse amongst them, which has not been copied over and
over again out of Ernulphus a thousand times: but, like all other
copies, how infinitely short of the force and spirit of the
original!&mdash;it is thought to be no bad oath&mdash;and by itself
passes very well&mdash;'G-d damn you.'&mdash;Set it beside
Ernulphus's&mdash;'God almighty the Father damn you&mdash;God the
Son damn you&mdash;God the Holy Ghost damn you'&mdash;you see 'tis
nothing.&mdash;There is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up
to: besides, he is more copious in his invention&mdash;possess'd
more of the excellencies of a swearer&mdash;had such a thorough
knowledge of the human frame, its membranes, nerves, ligaments,
knittings of the joints, and articulations,&mdash;that when
Ernulphus cursed&mdash;no part escaped him.&mdash;'Tis true there
is something of a hardness in his manner&mdash;and, as in Michael
Angelo, a want of grace&mdash;but then there is such a greatness of
gusto!</p>
<p>My father, who generally look'd upon every thing in a light very
different from all mankind, would, after all, never allow this to
be an original.&mdash;He considered rather Ernulphus's anathema, as
an institute of swearing, in which, as he suspected, upon the
decline of swearing in some milder pontificate, Ernulphus, by order
of the succeeding pope, had with great learning and diligence
collected together all the laws of it;&mdash;for the same reason
that Justinian, in the decline of the empire, had ordered his
chancellor Tribonian to collect the Roman or civil laws all
together into one code or digest&mdash;lest, through the rust of
time&mdash;and the fatality of all things committed to oral
tradition&mdash;they should be lost to the world for ever.</p>
<p>For this reason my father would oft-times affirm, there was not
an oath from the great and tremendous oath of William the conqueror
(By the splendour of God) down to the lowest oath of a scavenger
(Damn your eyes) which was not to be found in Ernulphus.&mdash;In
short, he would add&mdash;I defy a man to swear out of it.</p>
<p>The hypothesis is, like most of my father's, singular and
ingenious too;&mdash;nor have I any objection to it, but that it
overturns my own.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bless my soul!&mdash;my poor mistress is ready to
faint&mdash;and her pains are gone&mdash;and the drops are
done&mdash;and the bottle of julap is broke&mdash;and the nurse has
cut her arm&mdash;(and I, my thumb, cried Dr. Slop,) and the child
is where it was, continued Susannah,&mdash;and the midwife has
fallen backwards upon the edge of the fender, and bruised her hip
as black as your hat.&mdash;I'll look at it, quoth Dr
Slop.&mdash;There is no need of that, replied Susannah,&mdash;you
had better look at my mistress&mdash;but the midwife would gladly
first give you an account how things are, so desires you would go
up stairs and speak to her this moment.</p>
<p>Human nature is the same in all professions.</p>
<p>The midwife had just before been put over Dr. Slop's
head&mdash;He had not digested it.&mdash;No, replied Dr. Slop,
'twould be full as proper if the midwife came down to me.&mdash;I
like subordination, quoth my uncle Toby,&mdash;and but for it,
after the reduction of Lisle, I know not what might have become of
the garrison of Ghent, in the mutiny for bread, in the year
Ten.&mdash;Nor, replied Dr. Slop, (parodying my uncle Toby's
hobby-horsical reflection; though full as hobby-horsical
himself)&mdash;do I know, Captain Shandy, what might have become of
the garrison above stairs, in the mutiny and confusion I find all
things are in at present, but for the subordination of fingers and
thumbs to...&mdash;the application of which, Sir, under this
accident of mine, comes in so a propos, that without it, the cut
upon my thumb might have been felt by the Shandy family, as long as
the Shandy family had a name.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.VII.</h2>
<h3>Let us go back to the...&mdash;in the last chapter.</h3>
<p>It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at least it was so, when
eloquence flourished at Athens and Rome, and would be so now, did
orators wear mantles) not to mention the name of a thing, when you
had the thing about you in petto, ready to produce, pop, in the
place you want it. A scar, an axe, a sword, a pink'd doublet, a
rusty helmet, a pound and a half of pot-ashes in an urn, or a
three-halfpenny pickle pot&mdash;but above all, a tender infant
royally accoutred.&mdash;Tho' if it was too young, and the oration
as long as Tully's second Philippick&mdash;it must certainly have
beshit the orator's mantle.&mdash;And then again, if too
old,&mdash;it must have been unwieldly and incommodious to his
action&mdash;so as to make him lose by his child almost as much as
he could gain by it.&mdash;Otherwise, when a state orator has hit
the precise age to a minute&mdash;hid his Bambino in his mantle so
cunningly that no mortal could smell it&mdash;and produced it so
critically, that no soul could say, it came in by head and
shoulders&mdash;Oh Sirs! it has done wonders&mdash;It has open'd
the sluices, and turn'd the brains, and shook the principles, and
unhinged the politicks of half a nation.</p>
<p>These feats however are not to be done, except in those states
and times, I say, where orators wore mantles&mdash;and pretty large
ones too, my brethren, with some twenty or five-and-twenty yards of
good purple, superfine, marketable cloth in them&mdash;with large
flowing folds and doubles, and in a great style of
design.&mdash;All which plainly shews, may it please your worships,
that the decay of eloquence, and the little good service it does at
present, both within and without doors, is owing to nothing else in
the world, but short coats, and the disuse of trunk-hose.&mdash;We
can conceal nothing under ours, Madam, worth shewing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.VIII.</h2>
<p>Dr. Slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this
argumentation: for happening to have his green baize bag upon his
knees, when he began to parody my uncle Toby&mdash;'twas as good as
the best mantle in the world to him: for which purpose, when he
foresaw the sentence would end in his new-invented forceps, he
thrust his hand into the bag in order to have them ready to clap
in, when your reverences took so much notice of the..., which had
he managed&mdash;my uncle Toby had certainly been overthrown: the
sentence and the argument in that case jumping closely in one
point, so like the two lines which form the salient angle of a
ravelin,&mdash;Dr. Slop would never have given them up;&mdash;and
my uncle Toby would as soon have thought of flying, as taking them
by force: but Dr. Slop fumbled so vilely in pulling them out, it
took off the whole effect, and what was a ten times worse evil (for
they seldom come alone in this life) in pulling out his forceps,
his forceps unfortunately drew out the squirt along with it.</p>
<p>When a proposition can be taken in two senses&mdash;'tis a law
in disputation, That the respondent may reply to which of the two
he pleases, or finds most convenient for him.&mdash;This threw the
advantage of the argument quite on my uncle Toby's
side.&mdash;'Good God!' cried my uncle Toby, 'are children brought
into the world with a squirt?'</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.IX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;Upon my honour, Sir, you have tore every bit of skin
quite off the back of both my hands with your forceps, cried my
uncle Toby&mdash;and you have crush'd all my knuckles into the
bargain with them to a jelly. 'Tis your own fault, said Dr.
Slop&mdash;you should have clinch'd your two fists together into
the form of a child's head as I told you, and sat firm.&mdash;I did
so, answered my uncle Toby.&mdash;Then the points of my forceps
have not been sufficiently arm'd, or the rivet wants
closing&mdash;or else the cut on my thumb has made me a little
aukward&mdash;or possibly&mdash;'Tis well, quoth my father,
interrupting the detail of possibilities&mdash;that the experiment
was not first made upon my child's head-piece.&mdash;It would not
have been a cherry-stone the worse, answered Dr. Slop.&mdash;I
maintain it, said my uncle Toby, it would have broke the cerebellum
(unless indeed the skull had been as hard as a granado) and turn'd
it all into a perfect posset.&mdash;Pshaw! replied Dr. Slop, a
child's head is naturally as soft as the pap of an apple;&mdash;the
sutures give way&mdash;and besides, I could have extracted by the
feet after.&mdash;Not you, said she.&mdash;I rather wish you would
begin that way, quoth my father.</p>
<p>Pray do, added my uncle Toby.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.X.</h2>
<p>&mdash;And pray, good woman, after all, will you take upon you
to say, it may not be the child's hip, as well as the child's
head?&mdash;'Tis most certainly the head, replied the midwife.
Because, continued Dr. Slop (turning to my father) as positive as
these old ladies generally are&mdash;'tis a point very difficult to
know&mdash;and yet of the greatest consequence to be
known;&mdash;because, Sir, if the hip is mistaken for the
head&mdash;there is a possibility (if it is a boy) that the
forceps....</p>
<p>&mdash;What the possibility was, Dr. Slop whispered very low to
my father, and then to my uncle Toby.&mdash;There is no such
danger, continued he, with the head.&mdash;No, in truth quoth my
father&mdash;but when your possibility has taken place at the
hip&mdash;you may as well take off the head too.</p>
<p>&mdash;It is morally impossible the reader should understand
this&mdash;'tis enough Dr. Slop understood it;&mdash;so taking the
green baize bag in his hand, with the help of Obadiah's pumps, he
tripp'd pretty nimbly, for a man of his size, across the room to
the door&mdash;and from the door was shewn the way, by the good old
midwife, to my mother's apartments.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XI.</h2>
<p>It is two hours, and ten minutes&mdash;and no more&mdash;cried
my father, looking at his watch, since Dr. Slop and Obadiah
arrived&mdash;and I know not how it happens, Brother Toby&mdash;but
to my imagination it seems almost an age.</p>
<p>&mdash;Here&mdash;pray, Sir, take hold of my cap&mdash;nay, take
the bell along with it, and my pantoufles too.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, they are all at your service; and I freely make you a
present of 'em, on condition you give me all your attention to this
chapter.</p>
<p>Though my father said, 'he knew not how it happen'd,'&mdash;yet
he knew very well how it happen'd;&mdash;and at the instant he
spoke it, was pre-determined in his mind to give my uncle Toby a
clear account of the matter by a metaphysical dissertation upon the
subject of duration and its simple modes, in order to shew my uncle
Toby by what mechanism and mensurations in the brain it came to
pass, that the rapid succession of their ideas, and the eternal
scampering of the discourse from one thing to another, since Dr.
Slop had come into the room, had lengthened out so short a period
to so inconceivable an extent.&mdash;'I know not how it
happens&mdash;cried my father,&mdash;but it seems an age.'</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis owing entirely, quoth my uncle Toby, to the
succession of our ideas.</p>
<p>My father, who had an itch, in common with all philosophers, of
reasoning upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it
too&mdash;proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the
succession of ideas, and had not the least apprehension of having
it snatch'd out of his hands by my uncle Toby, who (honest man!)
generally took every thing as it happened;&mdash;and who, of all
things in the world, troubled his brain the least with abstruse
thinking;&mdash;the ideas of time and space&mdash;or how we came by
those ideas&mdash;or of what stuff they were made&mdash;or whether
they were born with us&mdash;or we picked them up afterwards as we
went along&mdash;or whether we did it in frocks&mdash;or not till
we had got into breeches&mdash;with a thousand other inquiries and
disputes about Infinity Prescience, Liberty, Necessity, and so
forth, upon whose desperate and unconquerable theories so many fine
heads have been turned and cracked&mdash;never did my uncle Toby's
the least injury at all; my father knew it&mdash;and was no less
surprized than he was disappointed, with my uncle's fortuitous
solution.</p>
<p>Do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my
father.</p>
<p>Not I, quoth my uncle.</p>
<p>&mdash;But you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk
about?</p>
<p>No more than my horse, replied my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>Gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping
his two hands together&mdash;there is a worth in thy honest
ignorance, brother Toby&mdash;'twere almost a pity to exchange it
for a knowledge.&mdash;But I'll tell thee.&mdash;</p>
<p>To understand what time is aright, without which we never can
comprehend infinity, insomuch as one is a portion of the
other&mdash;we ought seriously to sit down and consider what idea
it is we have of duration, so as to give a satisfactory account how
we came by it.&mdash;What is that to any body? quoth my uncle Toby.
(Vide Locke.) For if you will turn your eyes inwards upon your
mind, continued my father, and observe attentively, you will
perceive, brother, that whilst you and I are talking together, and
thinking, and smoking our pipes, or whilst we receive successively
ideas in our minds, we know that we do exist, and so we estimate
the existence, or the continuation of the existence of ourselves,
or any thing else, commensurate to the succession of any ideas in
our minds, the duration of ourselves, or any such other thing
co-existing with our thinking&mdash;and so according to that
preconceived&mdash;You puzzle me to death, cried my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis owing to this, replied my father, that in our
computations of time, we are so used to minutes, hours, weeks, and
months&mdash;and of clocks (I wish there was not a clock in the
kingdom) to measure out their several portions to us, and to those
who belong to us&mdash;that 'twill be well, if in time to come, the
succession of our ideas be of any use or service to us at all.</p>
<p>Now, whether we observe it or no, continued my father, in every
sound man's head, there is a regular succession of ideas of one
sort or other, which follow each other in train just like&mdash;A
train of artillery? said my uncle Toby&mdash;A train of a
fiddle-stick!&mdash;quoth my father&mdash;which follow and succeed
one another in our minds at certain distances, just like the images
in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of a
candle.&mdash;I declare, quoth my uncle Toby, mine are more like a
smoke-jack,&mdash;Then, brother Toby, I have nothing more to say to
you upon that subject, said my father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;What a conjuncture was here lost!&mdash;My father in one
of his best explanatory moods&mdash;in eager pursuit of a
metaphysical point into the very regions, where clouds and thick
darkness would soon have encompassed it about;&mdash;my uncle Toby
in one of the finest dispositions for it in the world;&mdash;his
head like a smoke-jack;&mdash;the funnel unswept, and the ideas
whirling round and round about in it, all obfuscated and darkened
over with fuliginous matter!&mdash;By the tomb-stone of
Lucian&mdash;if it is in being&mdash;if not, why then by his ashes!
by the ashes of my dear Rabelais, and dearer Cervantes!&mdash;my
father and my uncle Toby's discourse upon Time and
Eternity&mdash;was a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and the
petulancy of my father's humour, in putting a stop to it as he did,
was a robbery of the Ontologic Treasury of such a jewel, as no
coalition of great occasions and great men are ever likely to
restore to it again.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XIII.</h2>
<p>Tho' my father persisted in not going on with the
discourse&mdash;yet he could not get my uncle Toby's smoke-jack out
of his head&mdash;piqued as he was at first with it;&mdash;there
was something in the comparison at the bottom, which hit his fancy;
for which purpose, resting his elbow upon the table, and reclining
the right side of his head upon the palm of his hand&mdash;but
looking first stedfastly in the fire&mdash;he began to commune with
himself, and philosophize about it: but his spirits being wore out
with the fatigues of investigating new tracts, and the constant
exertion of his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had
taken their turn in the discourse&mdash;the idea of the smoke jack
soon turned all his ideas upside down&mdash;so that he fell asleep
almost before he knew what he was about.</p>
<p>As for my uncle Toby, his smoke-jack had not made a dozen
revolutions, before he fell asleep also.&mdash;Peace be with them
both!&mdash;Dr. Slop is engaged with the midwife and my mother
above stairs.&mdash;Trim is busy in turning an old pair of
jack-boots into a couple of mortars, to be employed in the siege of
Messina next summer&mdash;and is this instant boring the
touch-holes with the point of a hot poker.&mdash;All my heroes are
off my hands;&mdash;'tis the first time I have had a moment to
spare&mdash;and I'll make use of it, and write my preface.</p>
<p>The Author's Preface</p>
<p>No, I'll not say a word about it&mdash;here it is;&mdash;in
publishing it&mdash;I have appealed to the world&mdash;and to the
world I leave it;&mdash;it must speak for itself.</p>
<p>All I know of the matter is&mdash;when I sat down, my intent was
to write a good book; and as far as the tenuity of my understanding
would hold out&mdash;a wise, aye, and a discreet&mdash;taking care
only, as I went along, to put into it all the wit and the judgment
(be it more or less) which the great Author and Bestower of them
had thought fit originally to give me&mdash;so that, as your
worships see&mdash;'tis just as God pleases.</p>
<p>Now, Agalastes (speaking dispraisingly) sayeth, That there may
be some wit in it, for aught he knows&mdash;but no judgment at all.
And Triptolemus and Phutatorius agreeing thereto, ask, How is it
possible there should? for that wit and judgment in this world
never go together; inasmuch as they are two operations differing
from each other as wide as east from west&mdash;So, says
Locke&mdash;so are farting and hickuping, say I. But in answer to
this, Didius the great church lawyer, in his code de fartendi et
illustrandi fallaciis, doth maintain and make fully appear, That an
illustration is no argument&mdash;nor do I maintain the wiping of a
looking-glass clean to be a syllogism;&mdash;but you all, may it
please your worships, see the better for it&mdash;so that the main
good these things do is only to clarify the understanding, previous
to the application of the argument itself, in order to free it from
any little motes, or specks of opacular matter, which, if left
swimming therein, might hinder a conception and spoil all.</p>
<p>Now, my dear anti-Shandeans, and thrice able criticks, and
fellow-labourers (for to you I write this Preface)&mdash;and to
you, most subtle statesmen and discreet doctors (do&mdash;pull off
your beards) renowned for gravity and wisdom;&mdash;Monopolus, my
politician&mdash;Didius, my counsel; Kysarcius, my
friend;&mdash;Phutatorius, my guide;&mdash;Gastripheres, the
preserver of my life; Somnolentius, the balm and repose of
it&mdash;not forgetting all others, as well sleeping as waking,
ecclesiastical as civil, whom for brevity, but out of no resentment
to you, I lump all together.&mdash;Believe me, right worthy,</p>
<p>My most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf, and in
my own too, in case the thing is not done already for us&mdash;is,
that the great gifts and endowments both of wit and judgment, with
every thing which usually goes along with them&mdash;such as
memory, fancy, genius, eloquence, quick parts, and what not, may
this precious moment, without stint or measure, let or hindrance,
be poured down warm as each of us could bear it&mdash;scum and
sediment and all (for I would not have a drop lost) into the
several receptacles, cells, cellules, domiciles, dormitories,
refectories, and spare places of our brains&mdash;in such sort,
that they might continue to be injected and tunn'd into, according
to the true intent and meaning of my wish, until every vessel of
them, both great and small, be so replenish'd, saturated, and
filled up therewith, that no more, would it save a man's life,
could possibly be got either in or out.</p>
<p>Bless us!&mdash;what noble work we should make!&mdash;how should
I tickle it off!&mdash;and what spirits should I find myself in, to
be writing away for such readers!&mdash;and you&mdash;just
heaven!&mdash;with what raptures would you sit and read&mdash;but
oh!&mdash;'tis too much&mdash;I am sick&mdash;I faint away
deliciously at the thoughts of it&mdash;'tis more than nature can
bear!&mdash;lay hold of me&mdash;I am giddy&mdash;I am stone
blind&mdash;I'm dying&mdash;I am gone.&mdash;Help! Help!
Help!&mdash;But hold&mdash;I grow something better again, for I am
beginning to foresee, when this is over, that as we shall all of us
continue to be great wits&mdash;we should never agree amongst
ourselves, one day to an end:&mdash;there would be so much satire
and sarcasm&mdash;scoffing and flouting, with raillying and
reparteeing of it&mdash;thrusting and parrying in one corner or
another&mdash;there would be nothing but mischief among
us&mdash;Chaste stars! what biting and scratching, and what a
racket and a clatter we should make, what with breaking of heads,
rapping of knuckles, and hitting of sore places&mdash;there would
be no such thing as living for us.</p>
<p>But then again, as we should all of us be men of great judgment,
we should make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong; and
though we should abominate each other ten times worse than so many
devils or devilesses, we should nevertheless, my dear creatures, be
all courtesy and kindness, milk and honey&mdash;'twould be a second
land of promise&mdash;a paradise upon earth, if there was such a
thing to be had&mdash;so that upon the whole we should have done
well enough.</p>
<p>All I fret and fume at, and what most distresses my invention at
present, is how to bring the point itself to bear; for as your
worships well know, that of these heavenly emanations of wit and
judgment, which I have so bountifully wished both for your worships
and myself&mdash;there is but a certain quantum stored up for us
all, for the use and behoof of the whole race of mankind; and such
small modicums of 'em are only sent forth into this wide world,
circulating here and there in one bye corner or another&mdash;and
in such narrow streams, and at such prodigious intervals from each
other, that one would wonder how it holds out, or could be
sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many great estates,
and populous empires.</p>
<p>Indeed there is one thing to be considered, that in Nova Zembla,
North Lapland, and in all those cold and dreary tracks of the
globe, which lie more directly under the arctick and antartick
circles, where the whole province of a man's concernments lies for
near nine months together within the narrow compass of his
cave&mdash;where the spirits are compressed almost to
nothing&mdash;and where the passions of a man, with every thing
which belongs to them, are as frigid as the zone itself&mdash;there
the least quantity of judgment imaginable does the
business&mdash;and of wit&mdash;there is a total and an absolute
saving&mdash;for as not one spark is wanted&mdash;so not one spark
is given. Angels and ministers of grace defend us! what a dismal
thing would it have been to have governed a kingdom, to have fought
a battle, or made a treaty, or run a match, or wrote a book, or got
a child, or held a provincial chapter there, with so plentiful a
lack of wit and judgment about us! For mercy's sake, let us think
no more about it, but travel on as fast as we can southwards into
Norway&mdash;crossing over Swedeland, if you please, through the
small triangular province of Angermania to the lake of Bothmia;
coasting along it through east and west Bothnia, down to Carelia,
and so on, through all those states and provinces which border upon
the far side of the Gulf of Finland, and the north-east of the
Baltick, up to Petersbourg, and just stepping into
Ingria;&mdash;then stretching over directly from thence through the
north parts of the Russian empire&mdash;leaving Siberia a little
upon the left hand, till we got into the very heart of Russian and
Asiatick Tartary.</p>
<p>Now through this long tour which I have led you, you observe the
good people are better off by far, than in the polar countries
which we have just left:&mdash;for if you hold your hand over your
eyes, and look very attentively, you may perceive some small
glimmerings (as it were) of wit, with a comfortable provision of
good plain houshold judgment, which, taking the quality and
quantity of it together, they make a very good shift with&mdash;and
had they more of either the one or the other, it would destroy the
proper balance betwixt them, and I am satisfied moreover they would
want occasions to put them to use.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more
luxuriant island, where you perceive the spring-tide of our blood
and humours runs high&mdash;where we have more ambition, and pride,
and envy, and lechery, and other whoreson passions upon our hands
to govern and subject to reason&mdash;the height of our wit, and
the depth of our judgment, you see, are exactly proportioned to the
length and breadth of our necessities&mdash;and accordingly we have
them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and
creditable plenty, that no one thinks he has any cause to
complain.</p>
<p>It must however be confessed on this head, that, as our air
blows hot and cold&mdash;wet and dry, ten times in a day, we have
them in no regular and settled way;&mdash;so that sometimes for
near half a century together, there shall be very little wit or
judgment either to be seen or heard of amongst us:&mdash;the small
channels of them shall seem quite dried up&mdash;then all of a
sudden the sluices shall break out, and take a fit of running again
like fury&mdash;you would think they would never stop:&mdash;and
then it is, that in writing, and fighting, and twenty other gallant
things, we drive all the world before us.</p>
<p>It is by these observations, and a wary reasoning by analogy in
that kind of argumentative process, which Suidas calls dialectick
induction&mdash;that I draw and set up this position as most true
and veritable;</p>
<p>That of these two luminaries so much of their irradiations are
suffered from time to time to shine down upon us, as he, whose
infinite wisdom which dispenses every thing in exact weight and
measure, knows will just serve to light us on our way in this night
of our obscurity; so that your reverences and worships now find
out, nor is it a moment longer in my power to conceal it from you,
That the fervent wish in your behalf with which I set out, was no
more than the first insinuating How d'ye of a caressing prefacer,
stifling his reader, as a lover sometimes does a coy mistress, into
silence. For alas! could this effusion of light have been as easily
procured, as the exordium wished it&mdash;I tremble to think how
many thousands for it, of benighted travellers (in the learned
sciences at least) must have groped and blundered on in the dark,
all the nights of their lives&mdash;running their heads against
posts, and knocking out their brains without ever getting to their
journies end;&mdash;some falling with their noses perpendicularly
into sinks&mdash;others horizontally with their tails into kennels.
Here one half of a learned profession tilting full but against the
other half of it, and then tumbling and rolling one over the other
in the dirt like hogs.&mdash;Here the brethren of another
profession, who should have run in opposition to each other, flying
on the contrary like a flock of wild geese, all in a row the same
way.&mdash;What confusion!&mdash;what mistakes!&mdash;fiddlers and
painters judging by their eyes and
ears&mdash;admirable!&mdash;trusting to the passions
excited&mdash;in an air sung, or a story painted to the
heart&mdash;instead of measuring them by a quadrant.</p>
<p>In the fore-ground of this picture, a statesman turning the
political wheel, like a brute, the wrong way round&mdash;against
the stream of corruption&mdash;by Heaven!&mdash;instead of with
it.</p>
<p>In this corner, a son of the divine Esculapius, writing a book
against predestination; perhaps worse&mdash;feeling his patient's
pulse, instead of his apothecary's&mdash;a brother of the Faculty
in the back-ground upon his knees in tears&mdash;drawing the
curtains of a mangled victim to beg his forgiveness;&mdash;offering
a fee&mdash;instead of taking one.</p>
<p>In that spacious Hall, a coalition of the gown, from all the
bars of it, driving a damn'd, dirty, vexatious cause before them,
with all their might and main, the wrong way!&mdash;kicking it out
of the great doors, instead of, in&mdash;and with such fury in
their looks, and such a degree of inveteracy in their manner of
kicking it, as if the laws had been originally made for the peace
and preservation of mankind:&mdash;perhaps a more enormous mistake
committed by them still&mdash;a litigated point fairly hung
up;&mdash;for instance, Whether John o'Nokes his nose could stand
in Tom o'Stiles his face, without a trespass, or not&mdash;rashly
determined by them in five-and-twenty minutes, which, with the
cautious pros and cons required in so intricate a proceeding, might
have taken up as many months&mdash;and if carried on upon a
military plan, as your honours know an Action should be, with all
the stratagems practicable therein,&mdash;such as
feints,&mdash;forced
marches,&mdash;surprizes&mdash;ambuscades&mdash;mask-batteries, and
a thousand other strokes of generalship, which consist in catching
at all advantages on both sides&mdash;might reasonably have lasted
them as many years, finding food and raiment all that term for a
centumvirate of the profession.</p>
<p>As for the Clergy&mdash;No&mdash;if I say a word against them,
I'll be shot.&mdash;I have no desire; and besides, if I had&mdash;I
durst not for my soul touch upon the subject&mdash;with such weak
nerves and spirits, and in the condition I am in at present,
'twould be as much as my life was worth, to deject and contrist
myself with so bad and melancholy an account&mdash;and therefore
'tis safer to draw a curtain across, and hasten from it, as fast as
I can, to the main and principal point I have undertaken to clear
up&mdash;and that is, How it comes to pass, that your men of least
wit are reported to be men of most judgment.&mdash;But mark&mdash;I
say, reported to be&mdash;for it is no more, my dear Sirs, than a
report, and which, like twenty others taken up every day upon
trust, I maintain to be a vile and a malicious report into the
bargain.</p>
<p>This by the help of the observation already premised, and I hope
already weighed and perpended by your reverences and worships, I
shall forthwith make appear.</p>
<p>I hate set dissertations&mdash;and above all things in the
world, 'tis one of the silliest things in one of them, to darken
your hypothesis by placing a number of tall, opake words, one
before another, in a right line, betwixt your own and your reader's
conception&mdash;when in all likelihood, if you had looked about,
you might have seen something standing, or hanging up, which would
have cleared the point at once&mdash;'for what hindrance, hurt, or
harm doth the laudable desire of knowledge bring to any man, if
even from a sot, a pot, a fool, a stool, a winter-mittain, a
truckle for a pully, the lid of a goldsmith's crucible, an oil
bottle, an old slipper, or a cane chair?'&mdash;I am this moment
sitting upon one. Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair
of wit and judgment, by the two knobs on the top of the back of
it?&mdash;they are fastened on, you see, with two pegs stuck
slightly into two gimlet-holes, and will place what I have to say
in so clear a light, as to let you see through the drift and
meaning of my whole preface, as plainly as if every point and
particle of it was made up of sun-beams.</p>
<p>I enter now directly upon the point.</p>
<p>&mdash;Here stands wit&mdash;and there stands judgment, close
beside it, just like the two knobs I'm speaking of, upon the back
of this self-same chair on which I am sitting.</p>
<p>&mdash;You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts
of its frame&mdash;as wit and judgment are of ours&mdash;and like
them too, indubitably both made and fitted to go together, in
order, as we say in all such cases of duplicated
embellishments&mdash;to answer one another.</p>
<p>Now for the sake of an experiment, and for the clearer
illustrating this matter&mdash;let us for a moment take off one of
these two curious ornaments (I care not which) from the point or
pinnacle of the chair it now stands on&mdash;nay, don't laugh at
it,&mdash;but did you ever see, in the whole course of your lives,
such a ridiculous business as this has made of it?&mdash;Why, 'tis
as miserable a sight as a sow with one ear; and there is just as
much sense and symmetry in the one as in the
other:&mdash;do&mdash;pray, get off your seats only to take a view
of it,&mdash;Now would any man who valued his character a straw,
have turned a piece of work out of his hand in such a
condition?&mdash;nay, lay your hands upon your hearts, and answer
this plain question, Whether this one single knob, which now stands
here like a blockhead by itself, can serve any purpose upon earth,
but to put one in mind of the want of the other?&mdash;and let me
farther ask, in case the chair was your own, if you would not in
your consciences think, rather than be as it is, that it would be
ten times better without any knob at all?</p>
<p>Now these two knobs&mdash;or top ornaments of the mind of man,
which crown the whole entablature&mdash;being, as I said, wit and
judgment, which of all others, as I have proved it, are the most
needful&mdash;the most priz'd&mdash;the most calamitous to be
without, and consequently the hardest to come at&mdash;for all
these reasons put together, there is not a mortal among us, so
destitute of a love of good fame or feeding&mdash;or so ignorant of
what will do him good therein&mdash;who does not wish and
stedfastly resolve in his own mind, to be, or to be thought at
least, master of the one or the other, and indeed of both of them,
if the thing seems any way feasible, or likely to be brought to
pass.</p>
<p>Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in
aiming at the one&mdash;unless they laid hold of the
other,&mdash;pray what do you think would become of
them?&mdash;Why, Sirs, in spite of all their gravities, they must
e'en have been contented to have gone with their insides
naked&mdash;this was not to be borne, but by an effort of
philosophy not to be supposed in the case we are upon&mdash;so that
no one could well have been angry with them, had they been
satisfied with what little they could have snatched up and secreted
under their cloaks and great perriwigs, had they not raised a hue
and cry at the same time against the lawful owners.</p>
<p>I need not tell your worships, that this was done with so much
cunning and artifice&mdash;that the great Locke, who was seldom
outwitted by false sounds&mdash;was nevertheless bubbled here. The
cry, it seems, was so deep and solemn a one, and what with the help
of great wigs, grave faces, and other implements of deceit, was
rendered so general a one against the poor wits in this matter,
that the philosopher himself was deceived by it&mdash;it was his
glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand vulgar
errors;&mdash;but this was not of the number; so that instead of
sitting down coolly, as such a philosopher should have done, to
have examined the matter of fact before he philosophised upon
it&mdash;on the contrary he took the fact for granted, and so
joined in with the cry, and halloo'd it as boisterously as the
rest.</p>
<p>This has been made the Magna Charta of stupidity ever
since&mdash;but your reverences plainly see, it has been obtained
in such a manner, that the title to it is not worth a
groat:&mdash;which by-the-bye is one of the many and vile
impositions which gravity and grave folks have to answer for
hereafter.</p>
<p>As for great wigs, upon which I may be thought to have spoken my
mind too freely&mdash;I beg leave to qualify whatever has been
unguardedly said to their dispraise or prejudice, by one general
declaration&mdash;That I have no abhorrence whatever, nor do I
detest and abjure either great wigs or long beards, any farther
than when I see they are bespoke and let grow on purpose to carry
on this self-same imposture&mdash;for any purpose&mdash;peace be
with them!&mdash;&gt; mark only&mdash;I write not for them.</p>

<p>Every day for at least ten years together did my father resolve
to have it mended&mdash;'tis not mended yet;&mdash;no family but
ours would have borne with it an hour&mdash;and what is most
astonishing, there was not a subject in the world upon which my
father was so eloquent, as upon that of door-hinges.&mdash;And yet
at the same time, he was certainly one of the greatest bubbles to
them, I think, that history can produce: his rhetorick and conduct
were at perpetual handy-cuffs.&mdash;Never did the parlour-door
open&mdash;but his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to
it;&mdash;three drops of oil with a feather, and a smart stroke of
a hammer, had saved his honour for ever.</p>
<p>&mdash;Inconsistent soul that man is!&mdash;languishing under
wounds, which he has the power to heal!&mdash;his whole life a
contradiction to his knowledge!&mdash;his reason, that precious
gift of God to him&mdash;(instead of pouring in oil) serving but to
sharpen his sensibilities&mdash;to multiply his pains, and render
him more melancholy and uneasy under them!&mdash;Poor unhappy
creature, that he should do so!&mdash;Are not the necessary causes
of misery in this life enow, but he must add voluntary ones to his
stock of sorrow;&mdash;struggle against evils which cannot be
avoided, and submit to others, which a tenth part of the trouble
they create him would remove from his heart for ever?</p>

oil to be got, and a hammer to be found within ten miles of Shandy

<h2>Chapter 2.XV.</h2>
<p>When Corporal Trim had brought his two mortars to bear, he was
delighted with his handy-work above measure; and knowing what a
pleasure it would be to his master to see them, he was not able to
resist the desire he had of carrying them directly into his
parlour.</p>
<p>Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the
affair of hinges, I had a speculative consideration arising out of
it, and it is this.</p>
<p>Had the parlour door opened and turn'd upon its hinges, as a
door should do&mdash;</p>
<p>Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been turning
upon its hinges&mdash;(that is, in case things have all along gone
well with your worship,&mdash;otherwise I give up my
simile)&mdash;in this case, I say, there had been no danger either
to master or man, in corporal Trim's peeping in: the moment he had
beheld my father and my uncle Toby fast asleep&mdash;the
respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as
silent as death, and left them both in their arm-chairs, dreaming
as happy as he had found them: but the thing was, morally speaking,
so very impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge
was suffered to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances
my father submitted to upon its account&mdash;this was one; that he
never folded his arms to take his nap after dinner, but the
thoughts of being unavoidably awakened by the first person who
should open the door, was always uppermost in his imagination, and
so incessantly stepp'd in betwixt him and the first balmy presage
of his repose, as to rob him, as he often declared, of the whole
sweets of it.</p>
<p>'When things move upon bad hinges, an' please your lordships,
how can it be otherwise?'</p>
<p>Pray what's the matter? Who is there? cried my father, waking,
the moment the door began to creak.&mdash;I wish the smith would
give a peep at that confounded hinge.&mdash;'Tis nothing, an please
your honour, said Trim, but two mortars I am bringing
in.&mdash;They shan't make a clatter with them here, cried my
father hastily.&mdash;If Dr. Slop has any drugs to pound, let him
do it in the kitchen.&mdash;May it please your honour, cried Trim,
they are two mortar-pieces for a siege next summer, which I have
been making out of a pair of jack-boots, which Obadiah told me your
honour had left off wearing.&mdash;By Heaven! cried my father,
springing out of his chair, as he swore&mdash;I have not one
appointment belonging to me, which I set so much store by as I do
by these jack-boots&mdash;they were our great grandfather's brother
Toby&mdash;they were hereditary. Then I fear, quoth my uncle Toby,
Trim has cut off the entail.&mdash;I have only cut off the tops,
an' please your honour, cried Trim&mdash;I hate perpetuities as
much as any man alive, cried my father&mdash;but these jack-boots,
continued he (smiling, though very angry at the same time) have
been in the family, brother, ever since the civil wars;&mdash;Sir
Roger Shandy wore them at the battle of Marston-Moor.&mdash;I
declare I would not have taken ten pounds for them.&mdash;I'll pay
you the money, brother Shandy, quoth my uncle Toby, looking at the
two mortars with infinite pleasure, and putting his hand into his
breeches pocket as he viewed them&mdash;I'll pay you the ten pounds
this moment with all my heart and soul.&mdash;</p>
<p>Brother Toby, replied my father, altering his tone, you care not
what money you dissipate and throw away, provided, continued he,
'tis but upon a Siege.&mdash;Have I not one hundred and twenty
pounds a year, besides my half pay? cried my uncle Toby.&mdash;What
is that&mdash;replied my father hastily&mdash;to ten pounds for a
pair of jack-boots?&mdash;twelve guineas for your
pontoons?&mdash;half as much for your Dutch draw-bridge?&mdash;to
say nothing of the train of little brass artillery you bespoke last
week, with twenty other preparations for the siege of Messina:
believe me, dear brother Toby, continued my father, taking him
kindly by the hand&mdash;these military operations of yours are
above your strength;&mdash;you mean well brother&mdash;but they
carry you into greater expences than you were first aware
of;&mdash;and take my word, dear Toby, they will in the end quite
ruin your fortune, and make a beggar of you.&mdash;What signifies
it if they do, brother, replied my uncle Toby, so long as we know
'tis for the good of the nation?&mdash;</p>
<p>My father could not help smiling for his soul&mdash;his anger at
the worst was never more than a spark;&mdash;and the zeal and
simplicity of Trim&mdash;and the generous (though hobby-horsical)
gallantry of my uncle Toby, brought him into perfect good humour
with them in an instant.</p>
<p>Generous souls!&mdash;God prosper you both, and your
mortar-pieces too! quoth my father to himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XVI.</h2>
<p>All is quiet and hush, cried my father, at least above
stairs&mdash;I hear not one foot stirring.&mdash;Prithee Trim,
who's in the kitchen? There is no one soul in the kitchen, answered
Trim, making a low bow as he spoke, except Dr.
Slop.&mdash;Confusion! cried my father (getting upon his legs a
second time)&mdash;not one single thing has gone right this day!
had I faith in astrology, brother, (which, by the bye, my father
had) I would have sworn some retrograde planet was hanging over
this unfortunate house of mine, and turning every individual thing
in it out of its place.&mdash;Why, I thought Dr. Slop had been
above stairs with my wife, and so said you.&mdash;What can the
fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen!&mdash;He is busy, an'
please your honour, replied Trim, in making a bridge.&mdash;'Tis
very obliging in him, quoth my uncle Toby:&mdash;pray, give my
humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell him I thank him
heartily.</p>
<p>You must know, my uncle Toby mistook the bridge&mdash;as widely
as my father mistook the mortars:&mdash;but to understand how my
uncle Toby could mistake the bridge&mdash;I fear I must give you an
exact account of the road which led to it;&mdash;or to drop my
metaphor (for there is nothing more dishonest in an historian than
the use of one)&mdash;in order to conceive the probability of this
error in my uncle Toby aright, I must give you some account of an
adventure of Trim's, though much against my will, I say much
against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly
out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either
amongst the anecdotes of my uncle Toby's amours with widow Wadman,
in which corporal Trim was no mean actor&mdash;or else in the
middle of his and my uncle Toby's campaigns on the
bowling-green&mdash;for it will do very well in either
place;&mdash;but then if I reserve it for either of those parts of
my story&mdash;I ruin the story I'm upon;&mdash;and if I tell it
here&mdash;I anticipate matters, and ruin it there.</p>
<p>&mdash;What would your worship have me to do in this case?</p>
<p>&mdash;Tell it, Mr. Shandy, by all means.&mdash;You are a fool,
Tristram, if you do.</p>
<p>O ye powers! (for powers ye are, and great ones too)&mdash;which
enable mortal man to tell a story worth the hearing&mdash;that
kindly shew him, where he is to begin it&mdash;and where he is to
end it&mdash;what he is to put into it&mdash;and what he is to
leave out&mdash;how much of it he is to cast into a shade&mdash;and
whereabouts he is to throw his light!&mdash;Ye, who preside over
this vast empire of biographical freebooters, and see how many
scrapes and plunges your subjects hourly fall into;&mdash;will you
do one thing?</p>
<p>I beg and beseech you (in case you will do nothing better for
us) that wherever in any part of your dominions it so falls out,
that three several roads meet in one point, as they have done just
here&mdash;that at least you set up a guide-post in the centre of
them, in mere charity, to direct an uncertain devil which of the
three he is to take.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XVII.</h2>
<p>Tho' the shock my uncle Toby received the year after the
demolition of Dunkirk, in his affair with widow Wadman, had fixed
him in a resolution never more to think of the sex&mdash;or of
aught which belonged to it;&mdash;yet corporal Trim had made no
such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle Toby's case there was
a strange and unaccountable concurrence of circumstances, which
insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair and strong
citadel.&mdash;In Trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing in
the world, but of him and Bridget in the kitchen;&mdash;though in
truth, the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so
fond was he of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle Toby
employed his time and genius in tagging of points&mdash;I am
persuaded the honest corporal would have laid down his arms, and
followed his example with pleasure. When therefore my uncle Toby
sat down before the mistress&mdash;corporal Trim incontinently took
ground before the maid.</p>
<p>Now, my dear friend Garrick, whom I have so much cause to esteem
and honour&mdash;(why, or wherefore, 'tis no matter)&mdash;can it
escape your penetration&mdash;I defy it&mdash;that so many
play-wrights, and opificers of chit-chat have ever since been
working upon Trim's and my uncle Toby's pattern.&mdash;I care not
what Aristotle, or Pacuvius, or Bossu, or Ricaboni
say&mdash;(though I never read one of them)&mdash;there is not a
greater difference between a single-horse chair and madam
Pompadour's vis-a-vis; than betwixt a single amour, and an amour
thus nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing throughout a
grand drama&mdash;Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that
kind&mdash;is quite lost in five acts&mdash;but that is neither
here nor there.</p>
<p>After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine
months on my uncle Toby's quarter, a most minute account of every
particular of which shall be given in its proper place, my uncle
Toby, honest man! found it necessary to draw off his forces and
raise the siege somewhat indignantly.</p>
<p>Corporal Trim, as I said, had made no such bargain either with
himself&mdash;or with any one else&mdash;the fidelity however of
his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had
forsaken with disgust&mdash;he contented himself with turning his
part of the siege into a blockade;&mdash;that is, he kept others
off;&mdash;for though he never after went to the house, yet he
never met Bridget in the village, but he would either nod or wink,
or smile, or look kindly at her&mdash;or (as circumstances
directed) he would shake her by the hand&mdash;or ask her lovingly
how she did&mdash;or would give her a ribbon&mdash;and
now-and-then, though never but when it could be done with decorum,
would give Bridget a...&mdash;</p>
<p>Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five
years; that is from the demolition of Dunkirk in the year 13, to
the latter end of my uncle Toby's campaign in the year 18, which
was about six or seven weeks before the time I'm speaking
of.&mdash;When Trim, as his custom was, after he had put my uncle
Toby to bed, going down one moon-shiny night to see that every
thing was right at his fortifications&mdash;in the lane separated
from the bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly&mdash;he
espied his Bridget.</p>
<p>As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well
worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle Toby had
made, Trim courteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led
her in: this was not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth'd
trumpet of Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it
reach'd my father's, with this untoward circumstance along with it,
that my uncle Toby's curious draw-bridge, constructed and painted
after the Dutch fashion, and which went quite across the
ditch&mdash;was broke down, and somehow or other crushed all to
pieces that very night.</p>
<p>My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my
uncle Toby's hobby-horse; he thought it the most ridiculous horse
that ever gentleman mounted; and indeed unless my uncle Toby vexed
him about it, could never think of it once, without smiling at
it&mdash;so that it could never get lame or happen any mischance,
but it tickled my father's imagination beyond measure; but this
being an accident much more to his humour than any one which had
yet befall'n it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of entertainment
to him&mdash;Well&mdash;but dear Toby! my father would say, do tell
me seriously how this affair of the bridge happened.&mdash;How can
you teaze me so much about it? my uncle Toby would reply&mdash;I
have told it you twenty times, word for word as Trim told it
me.&mdash;Prithee, how was it then, corporal? my father would cry,
turning to Trim.&mdash;It was a mere misfortune, an' please your
honour;&mdash;I was shewing Mrs. Bridget our fortifications, and in
going too near the edge of the fosse, I unfortunately slipp'd
in&mdash;Very well, Trim! my father would cry&mdash;(smiling
mysteriously, and giving a nod&mdash;but without interrupting
him)&mdash;and being link'd fast, an' please your honour, arm in
arm with Mrs. Bridget, I dragg'd her after me, by means of which
she fell backwards soss against the bridge&mdash;and Trim's foot
(my uncle Toby would cry, taking the story out of his mouth)
getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the bridge
too.&mdash;It was a thousand to one, my uncle Toby would add, that
the poor fellow did not break his leg.&mdash;Ay truly, my father
would say&mdash;a limb is soon broke, brother Toby, in such
encounters.&mdash;And so, an' please your honour, the bridge, which
your honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us,
and splintered all to pieces.</p>
<p>At other times, but especially when my uncle Toby was so
unfortunate as to say a syllable about cannons, bombs, or
petards&mdash;my father would exhaust all the stores of his
eloquence (which indeed were very great) in a panegyric upon the
Battering-Rams of the ancients&mdash;the Vinea which Alexander made
use of at the siege of Troy.&mdash;He would tell my uncle Toby of
the Catapultae of the Syrians, which threw such monstrous stones so
many hundred feet, and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very
foundation:&mdash;he would go on and describe the wonderful
mechanism of the Ballista which Marcellinus makes so much rout
about!&mdash;the terrible effects of the Pyraboli, which cast
fire;&mdash;the danger of the Terebra and Scorpio, which cast
javelins.&mdash;But what are these, would he say, to the
destructive machinery of corporal Trim?&mdash;Believe me, brother
Toby, no bridge, or bastion, or sally-port, that ever was
constructed in this world, can hold out against such artillery.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby would never attempt any defence against the force
of this ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking
his pipe; in doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one night
after supper, that it set my father, who was a little phthisical,
into a suffocating fit of violent coughing: my uncle Toby leap'd up
without feeling the pain upon his groin&mdash;and, with infinite
pity, stood beside his brother's chair, tapping his back with one
hand, and holding his head with the other, and from time to time
wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief, which he pulled
out of his pocket.&mdash;The affectionate and endearing manner in
which my uncle Toby did these little offices&mdash;cut my father
thro' his reins, for the pain he had just been giving
him.&mdash;May my brains be knock'd out with a battering-ram or a
catapulta, I care not which, quoth my father to himself&mdash;if
ever I insult this worthy soul more!</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XVIII.</h2>
<p>The draw-bridge being held irreparable, Trim was ordered
directly to set about another&mdash;but not upon the same model:
for cardinal Alberoni's intrigues at that time being discovered,
and my uncle Toby rightly foreseeing that a flame would inevitably
break out betwixt Spain and the Empire, and that the operations of
the ensuing campaign must in all likelihood be either in Naples or
Sicily&mdash;he determined upon an Italian bridge&mdash;(my uncle
Toby, by-the-bye, was not far out of his conjectures)&mdash;but my
father, who was infinitely the better politician, and took the lead
as far of my uncle Toby in the cabinet, as my uncle Toby took it of
him in the field&mdash;convinced him, that if the king of Spain and
the Emperor went together by the ears, England and France and
Holland must, by force of their pre-engagements, all enter the
lists too;&mdash;and if so, he would say, the combatants, brother
Toby, as sure as we are alive, will fall to it again, pell-mell,
upon the old prize-fighting stage of Flanders;&mdash;then what will
you do with your Italian bridge?</p>
<p>&mdash;We will go on with it then upon the old model, cried my
uncle Toby.</p>
<p>When corporal Trim had about half finished it in that
style&mdash;my uncle Toby found out a capital defect in it, which
he had never thoroughly considered before. It turned, it seems,
upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle, one half of
which turning to one side of the fosse, and the other to the other;
the advantage of which was this, that by dividing the weight of the
bridge into two equal portions, it impowered my uncle Toby to raise
it up or let it down with the end of his crutch, and with one hand,
which, as his garrison was weak, was as much as he could well
spare&mdash;but the disadvantages of such a construction were
insurmountable;&mdash;for by this means, he would say, I leave one
half of my bridge in my enemy's possession&mdash;and pray of what
use is the other?</p>
<p>The natural remedy for this was, no doubt, to have his bridge
fast only at one end with hinges, so that the whole might be lifted
up together, and stand bolt upright&mdash;but that was rejected for
the reason given above.</p>
<p>For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one
of that particular construction which is made to draw back
horizontally, to hinder a passage; and to thrust forwards again to
gain a passage&mdash;of which sorts your worship might have seen
three famous ones at Spires before its destruction&mdash;and one
now at Brisac, if I mistake not;&mdash;but my father advising my
uncle Toby, with great earnestness, to have nothing more to do with
thrusting bridges&mdash;and my uncle foreseeing moreover that it
would but perpetuate the memory of the Corporal's
misfortune&mdash;he changed his mind for that of the marquis
d'Hopital's invention, which the younger Bernouilli has so well and
learnedly described, as your worships may see&mdash;Act. Erud.
Lips. an. 1695&mdash;to these a lead weight is an eternal balance,
and keeps watch as well as a couple of centinels, inasmuch as the
construction of them was a curve line approximating to a
cycloid&mdash;if not a cycloid itself.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any
man in England&mdash;but was not quite such a master of the
cycloid;&mdash;he talked however about it every day&mdash;the
bridge went not forwards.&mdash;We'll ask somebody about it, cried
my uncle Toby to Trim.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XIX.</h2>
<p>When Trim came in and told my father, that Dr. Slop was in the
kitchen, and busy in making a bridge&mdash;my uncle Toby&mdash;the
affair of the jack-boots having just then raised a train of
military ideas in his brain&mdash;took it instantly for granted
that Dr. Slop was making a model of the marquis d'Hopital's
bridge.&mdash;'tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle
Toby;&mdash;pray give my humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell
him I thank him heartily.</p>
<p>Had my uncle Toby's head been a Savoyard's box, and my father
peeping in all the time at one end of it&mdash;it could not have
given him a more distinct conception of the operations of my uncle
Toby's imagination, than what he had; so, notwithstanding the
catapulta and battering-ram, and his bitter imprecation about them,
he was just beginning to triumph&mdash;</p>
<p>When Trim's answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his
brows, and twisted it to pieces.</p>

<p>&mdash;This unfortunate draw-bridge of yours, quoth my

master's nose.&mdash;In bringing him into the world with his vile
instruments, he has crushed his nose, Susannah says, as flat as a
pancake to his face, and he is making a false bridge with a piece
of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of Susannah's stays, to
raise it up.</p>
<p>&mdash;Lead me, brother Toby, cried my father, to my room this
instant.</p>

<p>From the first moment I sat down to write my life for the
amusement of the world, and my opinions for its instruction, has a
cloud insensibly been gathering over my father.&mdash;A tide of
little evils and distresses has been setting in against
him.&mdash;Not one thing, as he observed himself, has gone right:
and now is the storm thicken'd and going to break, and pour down
full upon his head.</p>
<p>I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and
melancholy frame of mind that ever sympathetic breast was touched
with.&mdash;My nerves relax as I tell it.&mdash;Every line I write,
I feel an abatement of the quickness of my pulse, and of that
careless alacrity with it, which every day of my life prompts me to
say and write a thousand things I should not&mdash;And this moment
that I last dipp'd my pen into my ink, I could not help taking
notice what a cautious air of sad composure and solemnity there
appear'd in my manner of doing it.&mdash;Lord! how different from
the rash jerks and hair-brain'd squirts thou art wont, Tristram, to
transact it with in other humours&mdash;dropping thy
pen&mdash;spurting thy ink about thy table and thy books&mdash;as

<h2>Chapter 2.XXII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;I won't go about to argue the point with you&mdash;'tis
so&mdash;and I am persuaded of it, madam, as much as can be, 'That
both man and woman bear pain or sorrow (and, for aught I know,
pleasure too) best in a horizontal position.'</p>
<p>The moment my father got up into his chamber, he threw himself
prostrate across his bed in the wildest disorder imaginable, but at
the same time in the most lamentable attitude of a man borne down
with sorrows, that ever the eye of pity dropp'd a tear
for.&mdash;The palm of his right hand, as he fell upon the bed,
receiving his forehead, and covering the greatest part of both his
eyes, gently sunk down with his head (his elbow giving way
backwards) till his nose touch'd the quilt;&mdash;his left arm hung
insensible over the side of the bed, his knuckles reclining upon
the handle of the chamber-pot, which peep'd out beyond the
valance&mdash;his right leg (his left being drawn up towards his
body) hung half over the side of the bed, the edge of it pressing
upon his shin bone&mdash;He felt it not. A fix'd, inflexible sorrow
took possession of every line of his face.&mdash;He sigh'd
once&mdash;heaved his breast often&mdash;but uttered not a
word.</p>
<p>An old set-stitch'd chair, valanced and fringed around with
party coloured worsted bobs, stood at the bed's head, opposite to
the side where my father's head reclined.&mdash;My uncle Toby sat
him down in it.</p>
<p>Before an affliction is digested&mdash;consolation ever comes
too soon;&mdash;and after it is digested&mdash;it comes too late:
so that you see, madam, there is but a mark between these two, as
fine almost as a hair, for a comforter to take aim at:&mdash;my
uncle Toby was always either on this side, or on that of it, and
would often say, he believed in his heart he could as soon hit the
longitude; for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he drew
the curtain a little forwards, and having a tear at every one's
service&mdash;he pull'd out a cambrick handkerchief&mdash;gave a
low sigh&mdash;but held his peace.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;'All is not gain that is got into the purse.'&mdash;So
that notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the
oddest books in the universe, and had moreover, in himself, the
oddest way of thinking that ever man in it was bless'd with, yet it
had this drawback upon him after all&mdash;that it laid him open to
some of the oddest and most whimsical distresses; of which this
particular one, which he sunk under at present, is as strong an
example as can be given.</p>
<p>No doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child's nose, by
the edge of a pair of forceps&mdash;however scientifically
applied&mdash;would vex any man in the world, who was at so much
pains in begetting a child, as my father was&mdash;yet it will not
account for the extravagance of his affliction, nor will it justify
the un-christian manner he abandoned and surrendered himself up
to.</p>
<p>To explain this, I must leave him upon the bed for half an
hour&mdash;and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting
beside him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXIV.</h2>
<p>&mdash;I think it a very unreasonable demand&mdash;cried my
great-grandfather, twisting up the paper, and throwing it upon the
table.&mdash;By this account, madam, you have but two thousand
pounds fortune, and not a shilling more&mdash;and you insist upon
having three hundred pounds a year jointure for it.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Because,' replied my great-grandmother, 'you have little
or no nose, Sir.'&mdash;</p>
<p>Now before I venture to make use of the word Nose a second
time&mdash;to avoid all confusion in what will be said upon it, in
this interesting part of my story, it may not be amiss to explain
my own meaning, and define, with all possible exactness and
precision, what I would willingly be understood to mean by the
term: being of opinion, that 'tis owing to the negligence and
perverseness of writers in despising this precaution, and to
nothing else&mdash;that all the polemical writings in divinity are
not as clear and demonstrative as those upon a Will o' the Wisp, or
any other sound part of philosophy, and natural pursuit; in order
to which, what have you to do, before you set out, unless you
intend to go puzzling on to the day of judgment&mdash;but to give
the world a good definition, and stand to it, of the main word you
have most occasion for&mdash;changing it, Sir, as you would a
guinea, into small coin?&mdash;which done&mdash;let the father of
confusion puzzle you, if he can; or put a different idea either
into your head, or your reader's head, if he knows how.</p>
<p>In books of strict morality and close reasoning, such as I am
engaged in&mdash;the neglect is inexcusable; and Heaven is witness,
how the world has revenged itself upon me for leaving so many
openings to equivocal strictures&mdash;and for depending so much as
I have done, all along, upon the cleanliness of my readers
imaginations.</p>
<p>&mdash;Here are two senses, cried Eugenius, as we walk'd along,
pointing with the fore finger of his right hand to the word
Crevice, in the one hundred and seventy-eighth page of the first
volume of this book of books,&mdash;here are two senses&mdash;quoth
he.&mdash;And here are two roads, replied I, turning short upon
him&mdash;a dirty and a clean one&mdash;which shall we
take?&mdash;The clean, by all means, replied Eugenius. Eugenius,
said I, stepping before him, and laying my hand upon his
breast&mdash;to define&mdash;is to distrust.&mdash;Thus I triumph'd
over Eugenius; but I triumph'd over him as I always do, like a
fool.&mdash;'Tis my comfort, however, I am not an obstinate one:
therefore</p>
<p>I define a nose as follows&mdash;intreating only beforehand, and
beseeching my readers, both male and female, of what age,
complexion, and condition soever, for the love of God and their own
souls, to guard against the temptations and suggestions of the
devil, and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other ideas into
their minds, than what I put into my definition&mdash;For by the
word Nose, throughout all this long chapter of noses, and in every
other part of my work, where the word Nose occurs&mdash;I declare,
by that word I mean a nose, and nothing more, or less.</p>

<p>&mdash;'Because,' quoth my great grandmother, repeating the
words again&mdash;'you have little or no nose, Sir.'&mdash;</p>
<p>S'death! cried my great-grandfather, clapping his hand upon his
nose,&mdash;'tis not so small as that comes to;&mdash;'tis a full
inch longer than my father's.&mdash;Now, my great-grandfather's
nose was for all the world like unto the noses of all the men,
women, and children, whom Pantagruel found dwelling upon the island
of Ennasin.&mdash;By the way, if you would know the strange way of
getting a-kin amongst so flat-nosed a people&mdash;you must read
the book;&mdash;find it out yourself, you never can.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of clubs.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis a full inch, continued my grandfather, pressing up
the ridge of his nose with his finger and thumb; and repeating his
assertion&mdash;'tis a full inch longer, madam, than my
father's&mdash;You must mean your uncle's, replied my
great-grandmother.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXVI.</h2>
<p>&mdash;What an unconscionable jointure, my dear, do we pay out
of this small estate of ours, quoth my grandmother to my
grandfather.</p>
<p>My father, replied my grandfather, had no more nose, my dear,
saving the mark, than there is upon the back of my hand.</p>
<p>&mdash;Now, you must know, that my great-grandmother outlived my
grandfather twelve years; so that my father had the jointure to
pay, a hundred and fifty pounds half-yearly&mdash;(on Michaelmas
and Lady-day,)&mdash;during all that time.</p>
<p>No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than
my father.&mdash;And as far as a hundred pounds went, he would
fling it upon the table, guinea by guinea, with that spirited jerk
of an honest welcome, which generous souls, and generous souls
only, are able to fling down money: but as soon as ever he enter'd
upon the odd fifty&mdash;he generally gave a loud Hem! rubb'd the
side of his nose leisurely with the flat part of his fore
finger&mdash;inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the
cawl of his wig&mdash;look'd at both sides of every guinea as he
parted with it&mdash;and seldom could get to the end of the fifty
pounds, without pulling out his handkerchief, and wiping his
temples.</p>
<p>Defend me, gracious Heaven! from those persecuting spirits who
make no allowances for these workings within
us.&mdash;Never&mdash;O never may I lay down in their tents, who
cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of education,
and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors!</p>
<p>For three generations at least this tenet in favour of long
noses had gradually been taking root in our family.&mdash;Tradition
was all along on its side, and Interest was every half-year
stepping in to strengthen it; so that the whimsicality of my
father's brain was far from having the whole honour of this, as it
had of almost all his other strange notions.&mdash;For in a great
measure he might be said to have suck'd this in with his mother's
milk. He did his part however.&mdash;If education planted the
mistake (in case it was one) my father watered it, and ripened it
to perfection.</p>
<p>He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the
subject, that he did not conceive how the greatest family in
England could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of
six or seven short noses.&mdash;And for the contrary reason, he
would generally add, That it must be one of the greatest problems
in civil life, where the same number of long and jolly noses,
following one another in a direct line, did not raise and hoist it
up into the best vacancies in the kingdom.&mdash;He would often
boast that the Shandy family rank'd very high in king Harry the
VIIIth's time, but owed its rise to no state engine&mdash;he would
say&mdash;but to that only;&mdash;but that, like other families, he
would add&mdash;it had felt the turn of the wheel, and had never
recovered the blow of my great-grandfather's nose.&mdash;It was an
ace of clubs indeed, he would cry, shaking his head&mdash;and as
vile a one for an unfortunate family as ever turn'd up trumps.</p>
<p>&mdash;Fair and softly, gentle reader!&mdash;where is thy fancy
carrying thee!&mdash;If there is truth in man, by my
great-grandfather's nose, I mean the external organ of smelling, or
that part of man which stands prominent in his face&mdash;and which
painters say, in good jolly noses and well-proportioned faces,
should comprehend a full third&mdash;that is, measured downwards
from the setting on of the hair.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXVII.</h2>
<p>It is a singular blessing, that nature has form'd the mind of
man with the same happy backwardness and renitency against
conviction, which is observed in old dogs&mdash;'of not learning
new tricks.'</p>
<p>What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher
that ever existed be whisk'd into at once, did he read such books,
and observe such facts, and think such thoughts, as would eternally
be making him change sides!</p>
<p>Now, my father, as I told you last year, detested all
this&mdash;He pick'd up an opinion, Sir, as a man in a state of
nature picks up an apple.&mdash;It becomes his own&mdash;and if he
is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than give it
up.</p>
<p>I am aware that Didius, the great civilian, will contest this
point; and cry out against me, Whence comes this man's right to
this apple? ex confesso, he will say&mdash;things were in a state
of nature&mdash;The apple, is as much Frank's apple as John's.
Pray, Mr. Shandy, what patent has he to shew for it? and how did it
begin to be his? was it, when he set his heart upon it? or when he
gathered it? or when he chew'd it? or when he roasted it? or when
he peel'd, or when he brought it home? or when he
digested?&mdash;or when he&mdash;?&mdash;For 'tis plain, Sir, if
the first picking up of the apple, made it not his&mdash;that no
subsequent act could.</p>
<p>Brother Didius, Tribonius will answer&mdash;(now Tribonius the
civilian and church lawyer's beard being three inches and a half
and three eighths longer than Didius his beard&mdash;I'm glad he
takes up the cudgels for me, so I give myself no farther trouble
about the answer.)&mdash;Brother Didius, Tribonius will say, it is
a decreed case, as you may find it in the fragments of Gregorius
and Hermogines's codes, and in all the codes from Justinian's down
to the codes of Louis and Des Eaux&mdash;That the sweat of a man's
brows, and the exsudations of a man's brains, are as much a man's
own property as the breeches upon his backside;&mdash;which said
exsudations, &amp;c. being dropp'd upon the said apple by the
labour of finding it, and picking it up; and being moreover
indissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly annex'd, by the picker up,
to the thing pick'd up, carried home, roasted, peel'd, eaten,
digested, and so on;&mdash;'tis evident that the gatherer of the
apple, in so doing, has mix'd up something which was his own, with
the apple which was not his own, by which means he has acquired a
property;&mdash;or, in other words, the apple is John's apple.</p>
<p>By the same learned chain of reasoning my father stood up for
all his opinions; he had spared no pains in picking them up, and
the more they lay out of the common way, the better still was his
title.&mdash;No mortal claimed them; they had cost him moreover as
much labour in cooking and digesting as in the case above, so that
they might well and truly be said to be of his own goods and
chattels.&mdash;Accordingly he held fast by 'em, both by teeth and
claws&mdash;would fly to whatever he could lay his hands
on&mdash;and, in a word, would intrench and fortify them round with
as many circumvallations and breast-works, as my uncle Toby would a
citadel.</p>
<p>There was one plaguy rub in the way of this&mdash;the scarcity
of materials to make any thing of a defence with, in case of a
smart attack; inasmuch as few men of great genius had exercised
their parts in writing books upon the subject of great noses: by
the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is incredible! and I am
quite lost in my understanding, when I am considering what a
treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon
worse subjects&mdash;and how many millions of books in all
languages and in all possible types and bindings, have been
fabricated upon points not half so much tending to the unity and
peace-making of the world. What was to be had, however, he set the
greater store by; and though my father would oft-times sport with
my uncle Toby's library&mdash;which, by-the-bye, was ridiculous
enough&mdash;yet at the very same time he did it, he collected
every book and treatise which had been systematically wrote upon
noses, with as much care as my honest uncle Toby had done those
upon military architecture.&mdash;'Tis true, a much less table
would have held them&mdash;but that was not thy transgression, my
dear uncle.&mdash;</p>
<p>Here&mdash;but why here&mdash;rather than in any other part of
my story&mdash;I am not able to tell:&mdash;but here it is&mdash;my
heart stops me to pay to thee, my dear uncle Toby, once for all,
the tribute I owe thy goodness.&mdash;Here let me thrust my chair
aside, and kneel down upon the ground, whilst I am pouring forth
the warmest sentiment of love for thee, and veneration for the
excellency of thy character, that ever virtue and nature kindled in
a nephew's bosom.&mdash;Peace and comfort rest for evermore upon
thy head!&mdash;Thou enviedst no man's comforts&mdash;insultedst no
man's opinions&mdash;Thou blackenedst no man's
character&mdash;devouredst no man's bread: gently, with faithful
Trim behind thee, didst thou amble round the little circle of thy
pleasures, jostling no creature in thy way:&mdash;for each one's
sorrows, thou hadst a tear,&mdash;for each man's need, thou hadst a
shilling.</p>
<p>Whilst I am worth one, to pay a weeder&mdash;thy path from thy
door to thy bowling-green shall never be grown up.&mdash;Whilst
there is a rood and a half of land in the Shandy family, thy
fortifications, my dear uncle Toby, shall never be demolish'd.</p>

<p>My father's collection was not great, but to make amends, it was
curious; and consequently he was some time in making it; he had the
great good fortune hewever, to set off well, in getting
Bruscambille's prologue upon long noses, almost for
nothing&mdash;for he gave no more for Bruscambille than three
half-crowns; owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall-man
saw my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon
it.&mdash;There are not three Bruscambilles in
Christendom&mdash;said the stall-man, except what are chain'd up in

<p>To those who do not yet know of which gender Bruscambille
is&mdash;inasmuch as a prologue upon long noses might easily be
done by either&mdash;'twill be no objection against the

himself with Bruscambille after the manner in which, 'tis ten to

mistress&mdash;that is, from morning even unto night: which,
by-the-bye, how delightful soever it may prove to the
inamorato&mdash;is of little or no entertainment at all to
by-standers.&mdash;Take notice, I go no farther with the
simile&mdash;my father's eye was greater than his
appetite&mdash;his zeal greater than his knowledge&mdash;he
cool'd&mdash;his affections became divided&mdash;he got hold of
Prignitz&mdash;purchased Scroderus, Andrea Paraeus, Bouchet's
Evening Conferences, and above all, the great and learned Hafen
Slawkenbergius; of which, as I shall have much to say

<h2>Chapter 2.XXIX.</h2>
<p>Of all the tracts my father was at the pains to procure and
study in support of his hypothesis, there was not any one wherein
he felt a more cruel disappointment at first, than in the
celebrated dialogue between Pamphagus and Cocles, written by the
chaste pen of the great and venerable Erasmus, upon the various
uses and seasonable applications of long noses.&mdash;Now don't let
Satan, my dear girl, in this chapter, take advantage of any one
spot of rising ground to get astride of your imagination, if you
can any ways help it; or if he is so nimble as to slip on&mdash;let
me beg of you, like an unback'd filly, to frisk it, to squirt it,
to jump it, to rear it, to bound it&mdash;and to kick it, with long
kicks and short kicks, till like Tickletoby's mare, you break a
strap or a crupper, and throw his worship into the dirt.&mdash;You
need not kill him.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And pray who was Tickletoby's mare?&mdash;'tis just as
discreditable and unscholar-like a question, Sir, as to have asked
what year (ab. urb. con.) the second Punic war broke out.&mdash;Who
was Tickletoby's mare!&mdash;Read, read, read, read, my unlearned
reader! read&mdash;or by the knowledge of the great saint
Paraleipomenon&mdash;I tell you before-hand, you had better throw
down the book at once; for without much reading, by which your
reverence knows I mean much knowledge, you will no more be able to
penetrate the moral of the next marbled page (motley emblem of my
work!) than the world with all its sagacity has been able to
unravel the many opinions, transactions, and truths which still lie
mystically hid under the dark veil of the black one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXX.</h2>
<p>'Nihil me paenitet hujus nasi,' quoth Pamphagus;&mdash;that
is&mdash;'My nose has been the making of me.'&mdash;'Nec est cur
poeniteat,' replies Cocles; that is, 'How the duce should such a
nose fail?'</p>
<p>The doctrine, you see, was laid down by Erasmus, as my father
wished it, with the utmost plainness; but my father's
disappointment was, in finding nothing more from so able a pen, but
the bare fact itself; without any of that speculative subtilty or
ambidexterity of argumentation upon it, which Heaven had bestow'd
upon man on purpose to investigate truth, and fight for her on all
sides.&mdash;My father pish'd and pugh'd at first most
terribly&mdash;'tis worth something to have a good name. As the
dialogue was of Erasmus, my father soon came to himself, and read
it over and over again with great application, studying every word
and every syllable of it thro' and thro' in its most strict and
literal interpretation&mdash;he could still make nothing of it,
that way. Mayhap there is more meant, than is said in it, quoth my
father.&mdash;Learned men, brother Toby, don't write dialogues upon
long noses for nothing.&mdash;I'll study the mystick and the
allegorick sense&mdash;here is some room to turn a man's self in,
brother.</p>
<p>My father read on.&mdash;</p>
<p>Now I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships,
that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by
Erasmus, the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not without
its domestic conveniences also; for that in a case of
distress&mdash;and for want of a pair of bellows, it will do
excellently well, ad ixcitandum focum (to stir up the fire.)</p>
<p>Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond
measure, and had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within
him, as she had done the seeds of all other knowledge&mdash;so that
he had got out his penknife, and was trying experiments upon the
sentence, to see if he could not scratch some better sense into
it.&mdash;I've got within a single letter, brother Toby, cried my
father, of Erasmus his mystic meaning.&mdash;You are near enough,
brother, replied my uncle, in all conscience.&mdash;Pshaw! cried my
father, scratching on&mdash;I might as well be seven miles
off.&mdash;I've done it&mdash;said my father, snapping his
fingers&mdash;See, my dear brother Toby, how I have mended the
sense.&mdash;But you have marr'd a word, replied my uncle
Toby.&mdash;My father put on his spectacles&mdash;bit his
lip&mdash;and tore out the leaf in a passion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXI.</h2>
<p>O Slawkenbergius! thou faithful analyzer of my
Disgrazias&mdash;thou sad foreteller of so many of the whips and
short turns which on one stage or other of my life have come slap
upon me from the shortness of my nose, and no other cause, that I
am conscious of.&mdash;Tell me, Slawkenbergius! what secret impulse
was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how did it sound
in thy ears?&mdash;art thou sure thou heard'st it?&mdash;which
first cried out to thee&mdash;go&mdash;go, Slawkenbergius! dedicate
the labours of thy life&mdash;neglect thy pastimes&mdash;call forth
all the powers and faculties of thy nature&mdash;macerate thyself
in the service of mankind, and write a grand Folio for them, upon
the subject of their noses.</p>
<p>How the communication was conveyed into Slawkenbergius's
sensorium&mdash;so that Slawkenbergius should know whose finger
touch'd the key&mdash;and whose hand it was that blew the
bellows&mdash;as Hafen Slawkenbergius has been dead and laid in his
grave above fourscore and ten years&mdash;we can only raise
conjectures.</p>
<p>Slawkenbergius was play'd upon, for aught I know, like one of
Whitefield's disciples&mdash;that is, with such a distinct
intelligence, Sir, of which of the two masters it was that had been
practising upon his instrument&mdash;as to make all reasoning upon
it needless.</p>
<p>&mdash;For in the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the
world of his motives and occasions for writing, and spending so
many years of his life upon this one work&mdash;towards the end of
his prolegomena, which by-the-bye should have come first&mdash;but
the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt the
analytical contents of the book, and the book itself&mdash;he
informs his reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of
discernment, and was able to sit down cooly, and consider within
himself the true state and condition of man, and distinguish the
main end and design of his being;&mdash;or&mdash;to shorten my
translation, for Slawkenbergius's book is in Latin, and not a
little prolix in this passage&mdash;ever since I understood, quoth
Slawkenbergius, any thing&mdash;or rather what was what&mdash;and
could perceive that the point of long noses had been too loosely
handled by all who had gone before;&mdash;have I Slawkenbergius,
felt a strong impulse, with a mighty and unresistible call within
me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.</p>
<p>And to do justice to Slawkenbergius, he has entered the list
with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than
any one man who had ever entered it before him&mdash;and indeed, in
many respects, deserves to be en-nich'd as a prototype for all
writers, of voluminous works at least, to model their books
by&mdash;for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject&mdash;examined
every part of it dialectically&mdash;then brought it into full day;
dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of
his own natural parts could strike&mdash;or the profoundest
knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon
it&mdash;collating, collecting, and compiling&mdash;begging,
borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote
or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned:
so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered, not
only as a model&mdash;but as a thorough-stitched Digest and regular
institute of noses, comprehending in it all that is or can be
needful to be known about them.</p>
<p>For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many
(otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father's collecting,
wrote either, plump upon noses&mdash;or collaterally touching
them;&mdash;such for instance as Prignitz, now lying upon the table
before me, who with infinite learning, and from the most candid and
scholar-like examination of above four thousand different skulls,
in upwards of twenty charnel-houses in Silesia, which he had
rummaged&mdash;has informed us, that the mensuration and
configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in any
given tract of country, except Crim Tartary, where they are all
crush'd down by the thumb, so that no judgment can be formed upon
them&mdash;are much nearer alike, than the world
imagines;&mdash;the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere
trifle, not worth taking notice of;&mdash;but that the size and
jollity of every individual nose, and by which one nose ranks above
another, and bears a higher price, is owing to the cartilaginous
and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and sinuses the blood
and animal spirits being impell'd and driven by the warmth and
force of the imagination, which is but a step from it (bating the
case of idiots, whom Prignitz, who had lived many years in Turky,
supposes under the more immediate tutelage of Heaven)&mdash;it so
happens, and ever must, says Prignitz, that the excellency of the
nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of
the wearer's fancy.</p>
<p>It is for the same reason, that is, because 'tis all
comprehended in Slawkenbergius, that I say nothing likewise of
Scroderus (Andrea) who, all the world knows, set himself to oppugn
Prignitz with great violence&mdash;proving it in his own way, first
logically, and then by a series of stubborn facts, 'That so far was
Prignitz from the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the
nose, that on the contrary&mdash;the nose begat the fancy.'</p>
<p>&mdash;The learned suspected Scroderus of an indecent sophism in
this&mdash;and Prignitz cried out aloud in the dispute, that
Scroderus had shifted the idea upon him&mdash;but Scroderus went
on, maintaining his thesis.</p>
<p>My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two
sides he should take in this affair; when Ambrose Paraeus decided
it in a moment, and by overthrowing the systems, both of Prignitz
and Scroderus, drove my father out of both sides of the controversy
at once.</p>
<p>Be witness&mdash;</p>
<p>I don't acquaint the learned reader&mdash;in saying it, I
mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact
myself&mdash;</p>
<p>That this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nose-mender to
Francis the ninth of France, and in high credit with him and the
two preceding, or succeeding kings (I know not which)&mdash;and
that, except in the slip he made in his story of Taliacotius's
noses, and his manner of setting them on&mdash;he was esteemed by
the whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in
matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.</p>
<p>Now Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father, that the true and
efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the
world, and upon which Prignitz and Scroderus had wasted so much
learning and fine parts&mdash;was neither this nor that&mdash;but
that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the
softness and flaccidity in the nurse's breast&mdash;as the flatness
and shortness of puisne noses was to the firmness and elastic
repulsion of the same organ of nutrition in the hale and
lively&mdash;which, tho' happy for the woman, was the undoing of
the child, inasmuch as his nose was so snubb'd, so rebuff'd, so
rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive ad
mensuram suam legitimam;&mdash;but that in case of the flaccidity
and softness of the nurse or mother's breast&mdash;by sinking into
it, quoth Paraeus, as into so much butter, the nose was comforted,
nourish'd, plump'd up, refresh'd, refocillated, and set a growing
for ever.</p>
<p>I have but two things to observe of Paraeus; first, That he
proves and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum
of expression:&mdash;for which may his soul for ever rest in
peace!</p>
<p>And, secondly, that besides the systems of Prignitz and
Scroderus, which Ambrose Paraeus his hypothesis effectually
overthrew&mdash;it overthrew at the same time the system of peace
and harmony of our family; and for three days together, not only
embroiled matters between my father and my mother, but turn'd
likewise the whole house and every thing in it, except my uncle
Toby, quite upside down.</p>
<p>Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife,
never surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of
a street-door.</p>
<p>My mother, you must know&mdash;but I have fifty things more
necessary to let you know first&mdash;I have a hundred difficulties
which I have promised to clear up, and a thousand distresses and
domestick misadventures crowding in upon me thick and threefold,
one upon the neck of another. A cow broke in (tomorrow morning) to
my uncle Toby's fortifications, and eat up two rations and a half
of dried grass, tearing up the sods with it, which faced his
horn-work and covered way.&mdash;Trim insists upon being tried by a
court-martial&mdash;the cow to be shot&mdash;Slop to be
crucifix'd&mdash;myself to be tristram'd and at my very baptism
made a martyr of;&mdash;poor unhappy devils that we all
are!&mdash;I want swaddling&mdash;but there is no time to be lost
in exclamations&mdash;I have left my father lying across his bed,
and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair, sitting beside him, and
promised I would go back to them in half an hour; and
five-and-thirty minutes are laps'd already.&mdash;Of all the
perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in&mdash;this certainly
is the greatest, for I have Hafen Slawkenbergius's folio, Sir, to
finish&mdash;a dialogue between my father and my uncle Toby, upon
the solution of Prignitz, Scroderus, Ambrose Paraeus, Panocrates,
and Grangousier to relate&mdash;a tale out of Slawkenbergius to
translate, and all this in five minutes less than no time at
all;&mdash;such a head!&mdash;would to Heaven my enemies only saw
the inside of it!</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXII.</h2>
<p>There was not any one scene more entertaining in our
family&mdash;and to do it justice in this point;&mdash;and I here
put off my cap and lay it upon the table close beside my ink-horn,
on purpose to make my declaration to the world concerning this one
article the more solemn&mdash;that I believe in my soul (unless my
love and partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the
supreme Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a
family together (in that period at least of it which I have sat
down to write the story of)&mdash;where the characters of it were
cast or contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for
this end; or in which the capacities of affording such exquisite
scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to
night, were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as
in the Shandy Family.</p>
<p>Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this
whimsical theatre of ours&mdash;than what frequently arose out of
this self-same chapter of long noses&mdash;especially when my
father's imagination was heated with the enquiry, and nothing would
serve him but to heat my uncle Toby's too.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby would give my father all possible fair play in
this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoking his pipe
for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon his
head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive Prignitz and
Scroderus's solutions into it.</p>
<p>Whether they were above my uncle Toby's reason&mdash;or contrary
to it&mdash;or that his brain was like damp timber, and no spark
could possibly take hold&mdash;or that it was so full of saps,
mines, blinds, curtins, and such military disqualifications to his
seeing clearly into Prignitz and Scroderus's doctrines&mdash;I say
not&mdash;let schoolmen&mdash;scullions, anatomists, and engineers,
fight for it among themselves&mdash;</p>
<p>'Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my
father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my
uncle Toby, and render out of Slawkenbergius's Latin, of which, as
he was no great master, his translation was not always of the
purest&mdash;and generally least so where 'twas most
wanted.&mdash;This naturally open'd a door to a second
misfortune;&mdash;that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open
my uncle Toby's eyes&mdash;my father's ideas ran on as much faster
than the translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle
Toby's&mdash;neither the one or the other added much to the
perspicuity of my father's lecture.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXIII.</h2>
<p>The gift of ratiocination and making syllogisms&mdash;I mean in
man&mdash;for in superior classes of being, such as angels and
spirits&mdash;'tis all done, may it please your worships, as they
tell me, by Intuition;&mdash;and beings inferior, as your worships
all know&mdash;syllogize by their noses: though there is an island
swimming in the sea (though not altogether at its ease) whose
inhabitants, if my intelligence deceives me not, are so wonderfully
gifted, as to syllogize after the same fashion, and oft-times to
make very well out too:&mdash;but that's neither here nor
there&mdash;</p>
<p>The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, or&mdash;the
great and principal act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell
us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
one with another, by the intervention of a third (called the medius
terminus); just as a man, as Locke well observes, by a yard, finds
two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same length, which could not
be brought together, to measure their equality, by
juxta-position.</p>
<p>Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated
his systems of noses, and observed my uncle Toby's
deportment&mdash;what great attention he gave to every
word&mdash;and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what
wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of
it&mdash;surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger
and his thumb&mdash;then fore-right&mdash;then this way, and then
that, in all its possible directions and fore-shortenings&mdash;he
would have concluded my uncle Toby had got hold of the medius
terminus, and was syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of
each hypothesis of long noses, in order, as my father laid them
before him. This, by-the-bye, was more than my father
wanted&mdash;his aim in all the pains he was at in these
philosophick lectures&mdash;was to enable my uncle Toby not to
discuss&mdash;but comprehend&mdash;to hold the grains and scruples
of learning&mdash;not to weigh them.&mdash;My uncle Toby, as you
will read in the next chapter, did neither the one or the
other.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXIV.</h2>
<p>'Tis a pity, cried my father one winter's night, after a three
hours painful translation of Slawkenbergius&mdash;'tis a pity,
cried my father, putting my mother's threadpaper into the book for
a mark, as he spoke&mdash;that truth, brother Toby, should shut
herself up in such impregnable fastnesses, and be so obstinate as
not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest
siege.&mdash;</p>
<p>Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that
my uncle Toby's fancy, during the time of my father's explanation
of Prignitz to him&mdash;having nothing to stay it there, had taken
a short flight to the bowling-green;&mdash;his body might as well
have taken a turn there too&mdash;so that with all the semblance of
a deep school-man intent upon the medius terminus&mdash;my uncle
Toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and all its pros
and cons, as if my father had been translating Hafen Slawkenbergius
from the Latin tongue into the Cherokee. But the word siege, like a
talismanic power, in my father's metaphor, wafting back my uncle
Toby's fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch&mdash;he
open'd his ears&mdash;and my father observing that he took his pipe
out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with
a desire to profit&mdash;my father with great pleasure began his
sentence again&mdash;changing only the plan, and dropping the
metaphor of the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my
father apprehended from it.</p>
<p>'Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one side,
brother Toby&mdash;considering what ingenuity these learned men
have all shewn in their solutions of noses.&mdash;Can noses be
dissolved? replied my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;My father thrust back his chair&mdash;rose up&mdash;put
on his hat&mdash;took four long strides to the door&mdash;jerked it
open&mdash;thrust his head half way out&mdash;shut the door
again&mdash;took no notice of the bad hinge&mdash;returned to the
table&mdash;pluck'd my mother's thread-paper out of
Slawkenbergius's book&mdash;went hastily to his bureau&mdash;walked
slowly back&mdash;twisted my mother's thread-paper about his
thumb&mdash;unbutton'd his waistcoat&mdash;threw my mother's
thread-paper into the fire&mdash;bit her sattin pin-cushion in two,
fill'd his mouth with bran&mdash;confounded it;&mdash;but
mark!&mdash;the oath of confusion was levell'd at my uncle Toby's
brain&mdash;which was e'en confused enough already&mdash;the curse
came charged only with the bran&mdash;the bran, may it please your
honours, was no more than powder to the ball.</p>
<p>'Twas well my father's passions lasted not long; for so long as
they did last, they led him a busy life on't; and it is one of the
most unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations
of human nature, that nothing should prove my father's mettle so
much, or make his passions go off so like gun-powder, as the
unexpected strokes his science met with from the quaint simplicity
of my uncle Toby's questions.&mdash;Had ten dozen of hornets stung
him behind in so many different places all at one time&mdash;he
could not have exerted more mechanical functions in fewer
seconds&mdash;or started half so much, as with one single quaere of
three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his
hobby-horsical career.</p>
<p>'Twas all one to my uncle Toby&mdash;he smoked his pipe on with
unvaried composure&mdash;his heart never intended offence to his
brother&mdash;and as his head could seldom find out where the sting
of it lay&mdash;he always gave my father the credit of cooling by
himself.&mdash;He was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it
in the present case.</p>
<p>By all that's good! said my father, swearing, as he came to
himself, and taking the oath out of Ernulphus's digest of
curses&mdash;(though to do my father justice it was a fault (as he
told Dr. Slop in the affair of Ernulphus) which he as seldom
committed as any man upon earth)&mdash;By all that's good and
great! brother Toby, said my father, if it was not for the aids of
philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do&mdash;you would
put a man beside all temper.&mdash;Why, by the solutions of noses,
of which I was telling you, I meant, as you might have known, had
you favoured me with one grain of attention, the various accounts
which learned men of different kinds of knowledge have given the
world of the causes of short and long noses.&mdash;There is no
cause but one, replied my uncle Toby&mdash;why one man's nose is
longer than another's, but because that God pleases to have it
so.&mdash;That is Grangousier's solution, said my
father.&mdash;'Tis he, continued my uncle Toby, looking up, and not
regarding my father's interruption, who makes us all, and frames
and puts us together in such forms and proportions, and for such
ends, as is agreeable to his infinite wisdom,.&mdash;'Tis a pious
account, cried my father, but not philosophical&mdash;there is more
religion in it than sound science. 'Twas no inconsistent part of my
uncle Toby's character&mdash;that he feared God, and reverenced
religion.&mdash;So the moment my father finished his
remark&mdash;my uncle Toby fell a whistling Lillabullero with more
zeal (though more out of tune) than usual.&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXV.</h2>
<p>No matter&mdash;as an appendage to seamstressy, the thread-paper
might be of some consequence to my mother&mdash;of none to my
father, as a mark in Slawkenbergius. Slawkenbergius in every page
of him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible knowledge to my
father&mdash;he could not open him amiss; and he would often say in
closing the book, that if all the arts and sciences in the world,
with the books which treated of them, were lost&mdash;should the
wisdom and policies of governments, he would say, through disuse,
ever happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had wrote or
caused to be written, upon the strong or the weak sides of courts
and kingdoms, should they be forgot also&mdash;and Slawkenbergius
only left&mdash;there would be enough in him in all conscience, he
would say, to set the world a-going again. A treasure therefore was
he indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to be known of
noses, and every thing else&mdash;at matin, noon, and vespers was
Hafen Slawkenbergius his recreation and delight: 'twas for ever in
his hands&mdash;you would have sworn, Sir, it had been a canon's
prayer-book&mdash;so worn, so glazed, so contrited and attrited was
it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even
unto the other.</p>
<p>I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius as my
father;&mdash;there is a fund in him, no doubt: but in my opinion,
the best, I don't say the most profitable, but the most amusing
part of Hafen Slawkenbergius, is his tales&mdash;and, considering
he was a German, many of them told not without fancy:&mdash;these
take up his second book, containing nearly one half of his folio,
and are comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten
tales&mdash;Philosophy is not built upon tales; and therefore 'twas
certainly wrong in Slawkenbergius to send them into the world by
that name!&mdash;there are a few of them in his eighth, ninth, and
tenth decads, which I own seem rather playful and sportive, than
speculative&mdash;but in general they are to be looked upon by the
learned as a detail of so many independent facts, all of them
turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of his subject,
and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines
of noses.</p>
<p>As we have leisure enough upon our hands&mdash;if you give me
leave, madam, I'll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad.</p>
<p>Slawkenbergii Fabella (As Hafen Slawkenbergius de Nasis is
extremely scarce, it may not be unacceptable to the learned reader
to see the specimen of a few pages of his original; I will make no
reflection upon it, but that his story-telling Latin is much more
concise than his philosophic&mdash;and, I think, has more of
Latinity in it.)</p>
<p>Vespera quadam frigidula, posteriori in parte mensis Augusti,
peregrinus, mulo fusco colore incidens, mantica a tergo, paucis
indusiis, binis calceis, braccisque sericis coccineis repleta,
Argentoratum ingressus est.</p>
<p>Militi eum percontanti, quum portus intraret dixit, se apud
Nasorum promontorium fuisse, Francofurtum proficisci, et
Argentoratum, transitu ad fines Sarmatiae mensis intervallo,
reversurum.</p>
<p>Miles peregrini in faciem suspexit&mdash;Di boni, nova forma
nasi!</p>
<p>At multum mihi profuit, inquit peregrinus, carpum amento
extrahens, e quo pependit acinaces: Loculo manum inseruit; et magna
cum urbanitate, pilei parte anteriore tacta manu sinistra, ut
extendit dextram, militi florinum dedit et processit.</p>
<p>Dolet mihi, ait miles, tympanistam nanum et valgum alloquens,
virum adeo urbanum vaginam perdidisse: itinerari haud poterit nuda
acinaci; neque vaginam toto Argentorato, habilem
inveniet.&mdash;Nullam unquam habui, respondit peregrinus
respiciens&mdash;seque comiter inclinans&mdash;hoc more gesto,
nudam acinacem elevans, mulo lento progrediente, ut nasum tueri
possim.</p>
<p>Non immerito, benigne peregrine, respondit miles.</p>
<p>Nihili aestimo, ait ille tympanista, e pergamena factitius
est.</p>
<p>Prout christianus sum, inquit miles, nasus ille, ni sexties
major fit, meo esset conformis.</p>
<p>Crepitare audivi ait tympanista.</p>
<p>Mehercule! sanguinem emisit, respondit miles.</p>
<p>Miseret me, inquit tympanista, qui non ambo tetigimus!</p>
<p>Eodem temporis puncto, quo haec res argumentata fuit inter
militem et tympanistam, disceptabatur ibidem tubicine et uxore sua
qui tunc accesserunt, et peregrino praetereunte, restiterunt.</p>
<p>Quantus nasus! aeque longus est, ait tubicina, ac tuba.</p>
<p>Et ex eodem metallo, ait tubicen, velut sternutamento
audias.</p>
<p>Tantum abest, respondit illa, quod fistulam dulcedine
vincit.</p>
<p>Aeneus est, ait tubicen.</p>
<p>Nequaquam, respondit uxor.</p>
<p>Rursum affirmo, ait tubicen, quod aeneus est.</p>
<p>Rem penitus explorabo; prius, enim digito tangam, ait uxor, quam
dormivero,</p>
<p>Mulus peregrini gradu lento progressus est, ut unumquodque
verbum controversiae, non tantum inter militem et tympanistam,
verum etiam inter tubicinem et uxorum ejus, audiret.</p>
<p>Nequaquam, ait ille, in muli collum fraena demittens, et manibus
ambabus in pectus positis, (mulo lente progrediente) nequaquam, ait
ille respiciens, non necesse est ut res isthaec dilucidata foret.
Minime gentium! meus nasus nunquam tangetur, dum spiritus hos reget
artus&mdash;Ad quid agendum? air uxor burgomagistri.</p>
<p>Peregrinus illi non respondit. Votum faciebat tunc temporis
sancto Nicolao; quo facto, sinum dextrum inserens, e qua
negligenter pependit acinaces, lento gradu processit per plateam
Argentorati latam quae ad diversorium templo ex adversum ducit.</p>
<p>Peregrinus mulo descendens stabulo includi, et manticam inferri
jussit: qua aperta et coccineis sericis femoralibus extractis cum
argento laciniato (Greek), his sese induit, statimque, acinaci in
manu, ad forum deambulavit.</p>
<p>Quod ubi peregrinus esset ingressus, uxorem tubicinis obviam
euntem aspicit; illico cursum flectit, metuens ne nasus suus
exploraretur, atque ad diversorium regressus est&mdash;exuit se
vestibus; braccas coccineas sericas manticae imposuit mulumque
educi jussit.</p>
<p>Francofurtum proficiscor, ait ille, et Argentoratum quatuor
abhinc hebdomadis revertar.</p>
<p>Bene curasti hoc jumentam? (ait) muli faciem manu
demulcens&mdash;me, manticamque meam, plus sexcentis mille passibus
portavit.</p>
<p>Longa via est! respondet hospes, nisi plurimum esset
negoti.&mdash;Enimvero, ait peregrinus, a Nasorum promontorio
redii, et nasum speciosissimum, egregiosissimumque quem unquam
quisquam sortitus est, acquisivi?</p>
<p>Dum peregrinus hanc miram rationem de seipso reddit, hospes et
uxor ejus, oculis intentis, peregrini nasum contemplantur&mdash;Per
sanctos sanctasque omnes, ait hospitis uxor, nasis duodecim maximis
in toto Argentorato major est!&mdash;estne, ait illa mariti in
aurem insusurrans, nonne est nasus praegrandis?</p>
<p>Dolus inest, anime mi, ait hospes&mdash;nasus est falsus.</p>
<p>Verus est, respondit uxor&mdash;</p>
<p>Ex abiete factus est, ait ille, terebinthinum olet&mdash;</p>
<p>Carbunculus inest, ait uxor.</p>
<p>Mortuus est nasus, respondit hospes.</p>
<p>Vivus est ait illa,&mdash;et si ipsa vivam tangam.</p>
<p>Votum feci sancto Nicolao, ait peregrinus, nasum meum intactum
fore usque ad&mdash;Quodnam tempus? illico respondit illa.</p>
<p>Minimo tangetur, inquit ille (manibus in pectus compositis)
usque ad illam horam&mdash;Quam horam? ait illa&mdash;Nullam,
respondit peregrinus, donec pervenio ad&mdash;Quem
locum,&mdash;obsecro? ait illa&mdash;Peregrinus nil respondens mulo
conscenso discessit.</p>
<p>Slawkenbergius's Tale</p>
<p>It was one cool refreshing evening, at the close of a very
sultry day, in the latter end of the month of August, when a
stranger, mounted upon a dark mule, with a small cloak-bag behind
him, containing a few shirts, a pair of shoes, and a crimson-sattin
pair of breeches, entered the town of Strasburg.</p>
<p>He told the centinel, who questioned him as he entered the
gates, that he had been at the Promontory of Noses&mdash;was going
on to Frankfort&mdash;and should be back again at Strasburg that
day month, in his way to the borders of Crim Tartary.</p>
<p>The centinel looked up into the stranger's face&mdash;he never
saw such a Nose in his life!</p>
<p>&mdash;I have made a very good venture of it, quoth the
stranger&mdash;so slipping his wrist out of the loop of a black
ribbon, to which a short scymetar was hung, he put his hand into
his pocket, and with great courtesy touching the fore part of his
cap with his left hand, as he extended his right&mdash;he put a
florin into the centinel's hand, and passed on.</p>
<p>It grieves, me, said the centinel, speaking to a little dwarfish
bandy-legg'd drummer, that so courteous a soul should have lost his
scabbard&mdash;he cannot travel without one to his scymetar, and
will not be able to get a scabbard to fit it in all
Strasburg.&mdash;I never had one, replied the stranger, looking
back to the centinel, and putting his hand up to his cap as he
spoke&mdash;I carry it, continued he, thus&mdash;holding up his
naked scymetar, his mule moving on slowly all the time&mdash;on
purpose to defend my nose.</p>
<p>It is well worth it, gentle stranger, replied the centinel.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis not worth a single stiver, said the bandy-legg'd
drummer&mdash;'tis a nose of parchment.</p>
<p>As I am a true catholic&mdash;except that it is six times as
big&mdash;'tis a nose, said the centinel, like my own.</p>
<p>&mdash;I heard it crackle, said the drummer.</p>
<p>By dunder, said the centinel, I saw it bleed.</p>
<p>What a pity, cried the bandy-legg'd drummer, we did not both
touch it!</p>
<p>At the very time that this dispute was maintaining by the
centinel and the drummer&mdash;was the same point debating betwixt
a trumpeter and a trumpeter's wife, who were just then coming up,
and had stopped to see the stranger pass by.</p>
<p>Benedicity!&mdash;What a nose! 'tis as long, said the
trumpeter's wife, as a trumpet.</p>
<p>And of the same metal said the trumpeter, as you hear by its
sneezing.</p>
<p>'Tis as soft as a flute, said she.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis brass, said the trumpeter.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis a pudding's end, said his wife.</p>
<p>I tell thee again, said the trumpeter, 'tis a brazen nose,</p>
<p>I'll know the bottom of it, said the trumpeter's wife, for I
will touch it with my finger before I sleep.</p>
<p>The stranger's mule moved on at so slow a rate, that he heard
every word of the dispute, not only betwixt the centinel and the
drummer, but betwixt the trumpeter and trumpeter's wife.</p>
<p>No! said he, dropping his reins upon his mule's neck, and laying
both his hands upon his breast, the one over the other in a
saint-like position (his mule going on easily all the time) No!
said he, looking up&mdash;I am not such a debtor to the
world&mdash;slandered and disappointed as I have been&mdash;as to
give it that conviction&mdash;no! said he, my nose shall never be
touched whilst Heaven gives me strength&mdash;To do what? said a
burgomaster's wife.</p>
<p>The stranger took no notice of the burgomaster's wife&mdash;he
was making a vow to Saint Nicolas; which done, having uncrossed his
arms with the same solemnity with which he crossed them, he took up
the reins of his bridle with his left-hand, and putting his right
hand into his bosom, with the scymetar hanging loosely to the wrist
of it, he rode on, as slowly as one foot of the mule could follow
another, thro' the principal streets of Strasburg, till chance
brought him to the great inn in the market-place over-against the
church.</p>
<p>The moment the stranger alighted, he ordered his mule to be led
into the stable, and his cloak-bag to be brought in; then opening,
and taking out of it his crimson-sattin breeches, with a
silver-fringed&mdash;(appendage to them, which I dare not
translate)&mdash;he put his breeches, with his fringed cod-piece
on, and forth-with, with his short scymetar in his hand, walked out
to the grand parade.</p>
<p>The stranger had just taken three turns upon the parade, when he
perceived the trumpeter's wife at the opposite side of it&mdash;so
turning short, in pain lest his nose should be attempted, he
instantly went back to his inn&mdash;undressed himself, packed up
his crimson-sattin breeches, &amp;c. in his cloak-bag, and called
for his mule.</p>
<p>I am going forwards, said the stranger, for Frankfort&mdash;and
shall be back at Strasburg this day month.</p>
<p>I hope, continued the stranger, stroking down the face of his
mule with his left hand as he was going to mount it, that you have
been kind to this faithful slave of mine&mdash;it has carried me
and my cloak-bag, continued he, tapping the mule's back, above six
hundred leagues.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis a long journey, Sir, replied the master of the
inn&mdash;unless a man has great business.&mdash;Tut! tut! said the
stranger, I have been at the promontory of Noses; and have got me
one of the goodliest, thank Heaven, that ever fell to a single
man's lot.</p>
<p>Whilst the stranger was giving this odd account of himself, the
master of the inn and his wife kept both their eyes fixed full upon
the stranger's nose&mdash;By saint Radagunda, said the inn-keeper's
wife to herself, there is more of it than in any dozen of the
largest noses put together in all Strasburg! is it not, said she,
whispering her husband in his ear, is it not a noble nose?</p>
<p>'Tis an imposture, my dear, said the master of the
inn&mdash;'tis a false nose.</p>
<p>'Tis a true nose, said his wife.</p>
<p>'Tis made of fir-tree, said he, I smell the
turpentine.&mdash;</p>
<p>There's a pimple on it, said she.</p>
<p>'Tis a dead nose, replied the inn-keeper.</p>
<p>'Tis a live nose, and if I am alive myself, said the
inn-keeper's, wife, I will touch it.</p>
<p>I have made a vow to saint Nicolas this day, said the stranger,
that my nose shall not be touched till&mdash;Here the stranger
suspending his voice, looked up.&mdash;Till when? said she
hastily.</p>
<p>It never shall be touched, said he, clasping his hands and
bringing them close to his breast, till that hour&mdash;What hour?
cried the inn keeper's wife.&mdash;Never!&mdash;never! said the
stranger, never till I am got&mdash;For Heaven's sake, into what
place? said she&mdash;The stranger rode away without saying a
word.</p>
<p>The stranger had not got half a league on his way towards
Frankfort before all the city of Strasburg was in an uproar about
his nose. The Compline bells were just ringing to call the
Strasburgers to their devotions, and shut up the duties of the day
in prayer:&mdash;no soul in all Strasburg heard 'em&mdash;the city
was like a swarm of bees&mdash;men, women, and children, (the
Compline bells tinkling all the time) flying here and
there&mdash;in at one door, out at another&mdash;this way and that
way&mdash;long ways and cross ways&mdash;up one street, down
another street&mdash;in at this alley, out of that&mdash;did you
see it? did you see it? did you see it? O! did you see
it?&mdash;who saw it? who did see it? for mercy's sake, who saw
it?</p>
<p>Alack o'day! I was at vespers!&mdash;I was washing, I was
starching, I was scouring, I was quilting&mdash;God help me! I
never saw it&mdash;I never touch'd it!&mdash;would I had been a
centinel, a bandy-legg'd drummer, a trumpeter, a trumpeter's wife,
was the general cry and lamentation in every street and corner of
Strasburg.</p>
<p>Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the
great city of Strasburg, was the courteous stranger going on as
gently upon his mule in his way to Frankfort, as if he had no
concern at all in the affair&mdash;talking all the way he rode in
broken sentences, sometimes to his mule&mdash;sometimes to
himself&mdash;sometimes to his Julia.</p>
<p>O Julia, my lovely Julia!&mdash;nay I cannot stop to let thee
bite that thistle&mdash;that ever the suspected tongue of a rival
should have robbed me of enjoyment when I was upon the point of
tasting it.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Pugh!&mdash;'tis nothing but a thistle&mdash;never mind
it&mdash;thou shalt have a better supper at night.</p>
<p>&mdash;Banish'd from my country&mdash;my friends&mdash;from
thee.&mdash;</p>
<p>Poor devil, thou'rt sadly tired with thy
journey!&mdash;come&mdash;get on a little faster&mdash;there's
nothing in my cloak-bag but two shirts&mdash;a crimson-sattin pair
of breeches, and a fringed&mdash;Dear Julia!</p>
<p>&mdash;But why to Frankfort?&mdash;is it that there is a hand
unfelt, which secretly is conducting me through these meanders and
unsuspected tracts?</p>
<p>&mdash;Stumbling! by saint Nicolas! every step&mdash;why at this
rate we shall be all night in getting in&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;To happiness&mdash;or am I to be the sport of fortune and
slander&mdash;destined to be driven forth
unconvicted&mdash;unheard&mdash;untouch'd&mdash;if so, why did I
not stay at Strasburg, where justice&mdash;but I had sworn! Come,
thou shalt drink&mdash;to St. Nicolas&mdash;O Julia!&mdash;What
dost thou prick up thy ears at?&mdash;'tis nothing but a man,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The stranger rode on communing in this manner with his mule and
Julia&mdash;till he arrived at his inn, where, as soon as he
arrived, he alighted&mdash;saw his mule, as he had promised it,
taken good care of&mdash;took off his cloak-bag, with his
crimson-sattin breeches, &amp;c. in it&mdash;called for an omelet
to his supper, went to his bed about twelve o'clock, and in five
minutes fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>It was about the same hour when the tumult in Strasburg being
abated for that night,&mdash;the Strasburgers had all got quietly
into their beds&mdash;but not like the stranger, for the rest
either of their minds or bodies; queen Mab, like an elf as she was,
had taken the stranger's nose, and without reduction of its bulk,
had that night been at the pains of slitting and dividing it into
as many noses of different cuts and fashions, as there were heads
in Strasburg to hold them. The abbess of Quedlingberg, who with the
four great dignitaries of her chapter, the prioress, the deaness,
the sub-chantress, and senior canonness, had that week come to
Strasburg to consult the university upon a case of conscience
relating to their placket-holes&mdash;was ill all the night.</p>
<p>The courteous stranger's nose had got perched upon the top of
the pineal gland of her brain, and made such rousing work in the
fancies of the four great dignitaries of her chapter, they could
not get a wink of sleep the whole night thro' for it&mdash;there
was no keeping a limb still amongst them&mdash;in short, they got
up like so many ghosts.</p>
<p>The penitentiaries of the third order of saint Francis&mdash;the
nuns of mount Calvary&mdash;the Praemonstratenses&mdash;the
Clunienses (Hafen Slawkenbergius means the Benedictine nuns of
Cluny, founded in the year 940, by Odo, abbe de Cluny.)&mdash;the
Carthusians, and all the severer orders of nuns, who lay that night
in blankets or hair-cloth, were still in a worse condition than the
abbess of Quedlingberg&mdash;by tumbling and tossing, and tossing
and tumbling from one side of their beds to the other the whole
night long&mdash;the several sisterhoods had scratch'd and maul'd
themselves all to death&mdash;they got out of their beds almost
flay'd alive&mdash;every body thought saint Antony had visited them
for probation with his fire&mdash;they had never once, in short,
shut their eyes the whole night long from vespers to matins.</p>
<p>The nuns of saint Ursula acted the wisest&mdash;they never
attempted to go to bed at all.</p>
<p>The dean of Strasburg, the prebendaries, the capitulars and
domiciliars (capitularly assembled in the morning to consider the
case of butter'd buns) all wished they had followed the nuns of
saint Ursula's example.&mdash;</p>
<p>In the hurry and confusion every thing had been in the night
before, the bakers had all forgot to lay their leaven&mdash;there
were no butter'd buns to be had for breakfast in all
Strasburg&mdash;the whole close of the cathedral was in one eternal
commotion&mdash;such a cause of restlessness and disquietude, and
such a zealous inquiry into that cause of the restlessness, had
never happened in Strasburg, since Martin Luther, with his
doctrines, had turned the city upside down.</p>
<p>If the stranger's nose took this liberty of thrusting himself
thus into the dishes (Mr. Shandy's compliments to orators&mdash;is
very sensible that Slawkenbergius has here changed his
metaphor&mdash;which he is very guilty of:&mdash;that as a
translator, Mr. Shandy has all along done what he could to make him
stick to it&mdash;but that here 'twas impossible.) of religious
orders, &amp;c. what a carnival did his nose make of it, in those
of the laity!&mdash;'tis more than my pen, worn to the stump as it
is, has power to describe; tho', I acknowledge, (cries
Slawkenbergius with more gaiety of thought than I could have
expected from him) that there is many a good simile now subsisting
in the world which might give my countrymen some idea of it; but at
the close of such a folio as this, wrote for their sakes, and in
which I have spent the greatest part of my life&mdash;tho' I own to
them the simile is in being, yet would it not be unreasonable in
them to expect I should have either time or inclination to search
for it? Let it suffice to say, that the riot and disorder it
occasioned in the Strasburgers fantasies was so general&mdash;such
an overpowering mastership had it got of all the faculties of the
Strasburgers minds&mdash;so many strange things, with equal
confidence on all sides, and with equal eloquence in all places,
were spoken and sworn to concerning it, that turned the whole
stream of all discourse and wonder towards it&mdash;every soul,
good and bad&mdash;rich and poor&mdash;learned and
unlearned&mdash;doctor and student&mdash;mistress and
maid&mdash;gentle and simple&mdash;nun's flesh and woman's flesh,
in Strasburg spent their time in hearing tidings about
it&mdash;every eye in Strasburg languished to see it&mdash;every
finger&mdash;every thumb in Strasburg burned to touch it.</p>
<p>Now what might add, if any thing may be thought necessary to
add, to so vehement a desire&mdash;was this, that the centinel, the
bandy-legg'd drummer, the trumpeter, the trumpeter's wife, the
burgomaster's widow, the master of the inn, and the master of the
inn's wife, how widely soever they all differed every one from
another in their testimonies and description of the stranger's
nose&mdash;they all agreed together in two points&mdash;namely,
that he was gone to Frankfort, and would not return to Strasburg
till that day month; and secondly, whether his nose was true or
false, that the stranger himself was one of the most perfect
paragons of beauty&mdash;the finest-made man&mdash;the most
genteel!&mdash;the most generous of his purse&mdash;the most
courteous in his carriage, that had ever entered the gates of
Strasburg&mdash;that as he rode, with scymetar slung loosely to his
wrist, thro' the streets&mdash;and walked with his crimson-sattin
breeches across the parade&mdash;'twas with so sweet an air of
careless modesty, and so manly withal&mdash;as would have put the
heart in jeopardy (had his nose not stood in his way) of every
virgin who had cast her eyes upon him.</p>
<p>I call not upon that heart which is a stranger to the throbs and
yearnings of curiosity, so excited, to justify the abbess of
Quedlingberg, the prioress, the deaness, and sub-chantress, for
sending at noon-day for the trumpeter's wife: she went through the
streets of Strasburg with her husband's trumpet in her
hand,&mdash;the best apparatus the straitness of the time would
allow her, for the illustration of her theory&mdash;she staid no
longer than three days.</p>
<p>The centinel and bandy-legg'd drummer!&mdash;nothing on this
side of old Athens could equal them! they read their lectures under
the city-gates to comers and goers, with all the pomp of a
Chrysippus and a Crantor in their porticos.</p>
<p>The master of the inn, with his ostler on his left-hand, read
his also in the same stile&mdash;under the portico or gateway of
his stable-yard&mdash;his wife, hers more privately in a back room:
all flocked to their lectures; not promiscuously&mdash;but to this
or that, as is ever the way, as faith and credulity marshal'd
them&mdash;in a word, each Strasburger came crouding for
intelligence&mdash;and every Strasburger had the intelligence he
wanted.</p>
<p>'Tis worth remarking, for the benefit of all demonstrators in
natural philosophy, &amp;c. that as soon as the trumpeter's wife
had finished the abbess of Quedlingberg's private lecture, and had
begun to read in public, which she did upon a stool in the middle
of the great parade,&mdash;she incommoded the other demonstrators
mainly, by gaining incontinently the most fashionable part of the
city of Strasburg for her auditory&mdash;But when a demonstrator in
philosophy (cries Slawkenbergius) has a trumpet for an apparatus,
pray what rival in science can pretend to be heard besides him?</p>
<p>Whilst the unlearned, thro' these conduits of intelligence, were
all busied in getting down to the bottom of the well, where Truth
keeps her little court&mdash;were the learned in their way as busy
in pumping her up thro' the conduits of dialect
induction&mdash;they concerned themselves not with facts&mdash;they
reasoned&mdash;</p>
<p>Not one profession had thrown more light upon this subject than
the Faculty&mdash;had not all their disputes about it run into the
affair of Wens and oedematous swellings, they could not keep clear
of them for their bloods and souls&mdash;the stranger's nose had
nothing to do either with wens or oedematous swellings.</p>
<p>It was demonstrated however very satisfactorily, that such a
ponderous mass of heterogenous matter could not be congested and
conglomerated to the nose, whilst the infant was in Utera, without
destroying the statical balance of the foetus, and throwing it
plump upon its head nine months before the time.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The opponents granted the theory&mdash;they denied the
consequences.</p>
<p>And if a suitable provision of veins, arteries, &amp;c. said
they, was not laid in, for the due nourishment of such a nose, in
the very first stamina and rudiments of its formation, before it
came into the world (bating the case of Wens) it could not
regularly grow and be sustained afterwards.</p>
<p>This was all answered by a dissertation upon nutriment, and the
effect which nutriment had in extending the vessels, and in the
increase and prolongation of the muscular parts to the greatest
growth and expansion imaginable&mdash;In the triumph of which
theory, they went so far as to affirm, that there was no cause in
nature, why a nose might not grow to the size of the man
himself.</p>
<p>The respondents satisfied the world this event could never
happen to them so long as a man had but one stomach and one pair of
lungs&mdash;For the stomach, said they, being the only organ
destined for the reception of food, and turning it into
chyle&mdash;and the lungs the only engine of
sanguification&mdash;it could possibly work off no more, than what
the appetite brought it: or admitting the possibility of a man's
overloading his stomach, nature had set bounds however to his
lungs&mdash;the engine was of a determined size and strength, and
could elaborate but a certain quantity in a given time&mdash;that
is, it could produce just as much blood as was sufficient for one
single man, and no more; so that, if there was as much nose as
man&mdash;they proved a mortification must necessarily ensue; and
forasmuch as there could not be a support for both, that the nose
must either fall off from the man, or the man inevitably fall off
from his nose.</p>
<p>Nature accommodates herself to these emergencies, cried the
opponents&mdash;else what do you say to the case of a whole
stomach&mdash;a whole pair of lungs, and but half a man, when both
his legs have been unfortunately shot off?</p>
<p>He dies of a plethora, said they&mdash;or must spit blood, and
in a fortnight or three weeks go off in a consumption.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It happens otherwise&mdash;replied the
opponents.&mdash;</p>
<p>It ought not, said they.</p>
<p>The more curious and intimate inquirers after nature and her
doings, though they went hand in hand a good way together, yet they
all divided about the nose at last, almost as much as the Faculty
itself</p>
<p>They amicably laid it down, that there was a just and
geometrical arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the
human frame to its several destinations, offices, and functions,
which could not be transgressed but within certain
limits&mdash;that nature, though she sported&mdash;she sported
within a certain circle;&mdash;and they could not agree about the
diameter of it.</p>
<p>The logicians stuck much closer to the point before them than
any of the classes of the literati;&mdash;they began and ended with
the word Nose; and had it not been for a petitio principii, which
one of the ablest of them ran his head against in the beginning of
the combat, the whole controversy had been settled at once.</p>
<p>A nose, argued the logician, cannot bleed without
blood&mdash;and not only blood&mdash;but blood circulating in it to
supply the phaenomenon with a succession of drops&mdash;(a stream
being but a quicker succession of drops, that is included, said
he.)&mdash;Now death, continued the logician, being nothing but the
stagnation of the blood&mdash;</p>
<p>I deny the definition&mdash;Death is the separation of the soul
from the body, said his antagonist&mdash;Then we don't agree about
our weapons, said the logician&mdash;Then there is an end of the
dispute, replied the antagonist.</p>
<p>The civilians were still more concise: what they offered being
more in the nature of a decree&mdash;than a dispute.</p>
<p>Such a monstrous nose, said they, had it been a true nose, could
not possibly have been suffered in civil society&mdash;and if
false&mdash;to impose upon society with such false signs and
tokens, was a still greater violation of its rights, and must have
had still less mercy shewn it.</p>
<p>The only objection to this was, that if it proved any thing, it
proved the stranger's nose was neither true nor false.</p>
<p>This left room for the controversy to go on. It was maintained
by the advocates of the ecclesiastic court, that there was nothing
to inhibit a decree, since the stranger ex mero motu had confessed
he had been at the Promontory of Noses, and had got one of the
goodliest, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;To this it was answered, it was
impossible there should be such a place as the Promontory of Noses,
and the learned be ignorant where it lay. The commissary of the
bishop of Strasburg undertook the advocates, explained this matter
in a treatise upon proverbial phrases, shewing them, that the
Promontory of Noses was a mere allegorick expression, importing no
more than that nature had given him a long nose: in proof of which,
with great learning, he cited the underwritten authorities,

decided the point incontestably, had it not appeared that a dispute
about some franchises of dean and chapter-lands had been determined
by it nineteen years before.</p>
<p>It happened&mdash;I must say unluckily for Truth, because they
were giving her a lift another way in so doing; that the two
universities of Strasburg&mdash;the Lutheran, founded in the year
1538 by Jacobus Surmis, counsellor of the senate,&mdash;and the
Popish, founded by Leopold, arch-duke of Austria, were, during all
this time, employing the whole depth of their knowledge (except
just what the affair of the abbess of Quedlingberg's placket-holes
required)&mdash;in determining the point of Martin Luther's
damnation.</p>
<p>The Popish doctors had undertaken to demonstrate a priori, that
from the necessary influence of the planets on the twenty-second
day of October 1483&mdash;when the moon was in the twelfth house,
Jupiter, Mars, and Venus in the third, the Sun, Saturn, and
Mercury, all got together in the fourth&mdash;that he must in
course, and unavoidably, be a damn'd man&mdash;and that his
doctrines, by a direct corollary, must be damn'd doctrines too.</p>
<p>By inspection into his horoscope, where five planets were in
coition all at once with Scorpio (Haec mira, satisque horrenda.
Planetarum coitio sub Scorpio Asterismo in nona coeli statione,
quam Arabes religioni deputabant efficit Martinum Lutherum
sacrilegum hereticum, Christianae religionis hostem acerrimum atque
prophanum, ex horoscopi directione ad Martis coitum,
religiosissimus obiit, ejus Anima scelestissima ad infernos
navigavit&mdash;ab Alecto, Tisiphone &amp; Megara flagellis igneis
cruciata perenniter.&mdash;Lucas Gaurieus in Tractatu astrologico
de praeteritis multorum hominum accidentibus per genituras
examinatis.) (in reading this my father would always shake his
head) in the ninth house, with the Arabians allotted to
religion&mdash;it appeared that Martin Luther did not care one
stiver about the matter&mdash;and that from the horoscope directed
to the conjunction of Mars&mdash;they made it plain likewise he
must die cursing and blaspheming&mdash;with the blast of which his
soul (being steep'd in guilt) sailed before the wind, in the lake
of hell-fire.</p>
<p>The little objection of the Lutheran doctors to this, was, that
it must certainly be the soul of another man, born Oct. 22, 83.
which was forced to sail down before the wind in that
manner&mdash;inasmuch as it appeared from the register of Islaben
in the county of Mansfelt, that Luther was not born in the year
1483, but in 84; and not on the 22d day of October, but on the 10th
of November, the eve of Martinmas day, from whence he had the name
of Martin.</p>
<p>(&mdash;I must break off my translation for a moment; for if I
did not, I know I should no more be able to shut my eyes in bed,
than the abbess of Quedlingberg&mdash;It is to tell the reader;
that my father never read this passage of Slawkenbergius to my
uncle Toby, but with triumph&mdash;not over my uncle Toby, for he
never opposed him in it&mdash;but over the whole world.</p>
<p>&mdash;Now you see, brother Toby, he would say, looking up,
'that christian names are not such indifferent things;'&mdash;had
Luther here been called by any other name but Martin, he would have
been damn'd to all eternity&mdash;Not that I look upon Martin, he
would add, as a good name&mdash;far from it&mdash;'tis something
better than a neutral, and but a little&mdash;yet little as it is
you see it was of some service to him.</p>
<p>My father knew the weakness of this prop to his hypothesis, as
well as the best logician could shew him&mdash;yet so strange is
the weakness of man at the same time, as it fell in his way, he
could not for his life but make use of it; and it was certainly for
this reason, that though there are many stories in Hafen
Slawkenbergius's Decades full as entertaining as this I am
translating, yet there is not one amongst them which my father read
over with half the delight&mdash;it flattered two of his strangest
hypotheses together&mdash;his Names and his Noses.&mdash;I will be
bold to say, he might have read all the books in the Alexandrian
Library, had not fate taken other care of them, and not have met
with a book or passage in one, which hit two such nails as these
upon the head at one stroke.)</p>
<p>The two universities of Strasburg were hard tugging at this
affair of Luther's navigation. The Protestant doctors had
demonstrated, that he had not sailed right before the wind, as the
Popish doctors had pretended; and as every one knew there was no
sailing full in the teeth of it&mdash;they were going to settle, in
case he had sailed, how many points he was off; whether Martin had
doubled the cape, or had fallen upon a lee-shore; and no doubt, as
it was an enquiry of much edification, at least to those who
understood this sort of Navigation, they had gone on with it in
spite of the size of the stranger's nose, had not the size of the
stranger's nose drawn off the attention of the world from what they
were about&mdash;it was their business to follow.</p>
<p>The abbess of Quedlingberg and her four dignitaries was no stop;
for the enormity of the stranger's nose running full as much in
their fancies as their case of conscience&mdash;the affair of their
placket-holes kept cold&mdash;in a word, the printers were ordered
to distribute their types&mdash;all controversies dropp'd.</p>
<p>'Twas a square cap with a silver tassel upon the crown of
it&mdash;to a nut-shell&mdash;to have guessed on which side of the
nose the two universities would split.</p>
<p>'Tis above reason, cried the doctors on one side.</p>
<p>'Tis below reason, cried the others.</p>
<p>'Tis faith, cried one.</p>
<p>'Tis a fiddle-stick, said the other.</p>
<p>'Tis possible, cried the one.</p>
<p>'Tis impossible, said the other.</p>
<p>God's power is infinite, cried the Nosarians, he can do any
thing.</p>
<p>He can do nothing, replied the Anti-nosarians, which implies
contradictions.</p>
<p>He can make matter think, said the Nosarians.</p>
<p>As certainly as you can make a velvet cap out of a sow's ear,
replied the Anti-nosarians.</p>
<p>He cannot make two and two five, replied the Popish
doctors.&mdash;'Tis false, said their other opponents.&mdash;</p>
<p>Infinite power is infinite power, said the doctors who
maintained the reality of the nose.&mdash;It extends only to all
possible things, replied the Lutherans.</p>
<p>By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose,
if he thinks fit, as big as the steeple of Strasburg.</p>
<p>Now the steeple of Strasburg being the biggest and the tallest
church-steeple to be seen in the whole world, the Anti-nosarians
denied that a nose of 575 geometrical feet in length could be worn,
at least by a middle-siz'd man&mdash;The Popish doctors swore it
could&mdash;The Lutheran doctors said No;&mdash;it could not.</p>
<p>This at once started a new dispute, which they pursued a great
way, upon the extent and limitation of the moral and natural
attributes of God&mdash;That controversy led them naturally into
Thomas Aquinas, and Thomas Aquinas to the devil.</p>
<p>The stranger's nose was no more heard of in the dispute&mdash;it
just served as a frigate to launch them into the gulph of
school-divinity&mdash;and then they all sailed before the wind.</p>
<p>Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge.</p>
<p>The controversy about the attributes, &amp;c. instead of
cooling, on the contrary had inflamed the Strasburgers imaginations
to a most inordinate degree&mdash;The less they understood of the
matter the greater was their wonder about it&mdash;they were left
in all the distresses of desire unsatisfied&mdash;saw their
doctors, the Parchmentarians, the Brassarians, the Turpentarians,
on one side&mdash;the Popish doctors on the other, like Pantagruel
and his companions in quest of the oracle of the bottle, all
embarked out of sight.</p>
<p>&mdash;The poor Strasburgers left upon the beach!</p>
<p>&mdash;What was to be done?&mdash;No delay&mdash;the uproar
increased&mdash;every one in disorder&mdash;the city gates set
open.&mdash;</p>
<p>Unfortunate Strasbergers! was there in the store-house of
nature&mdash;was there in the lumber-rooms of learning&mdash;was
there in the great arsenal of chance, one single engine left
undrawn forth to torture your curiosities, and stretch your
desires, which was not pointed by the hand of Fate to play upon
your hearts?&mdash;I dip not my pen into my ink to excuse the
surrender of yourselves&mdash;'tis to write your panegyrick. Shew
me a city so macerated with expectation&mdash;who neither eat, or
drank, or slept, or prayed, or hearkened to the calls either of
religion or nature, for seven-and-twenty days together, who could
have held out one day longer.</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth the courteous stranger had promised to
return to Strasburg.</p>
<p>Seven thousand coaches (Slawkenbergius must certainly have made
some mistake in his numeral characters) 7000 coaches&mdash;15000
single-horse chairs&mdash;20000 waggons, crowded as full as they
could all hold with senators, counsellors, syndicks&mdash;beguines,
widows, wives, virgins, canons, concubines, all in their
coaches&mdash;The abbess of Quedlingberg, with the prioress, the
deaness and sub-chantress, leading the procession in one coach, and
the dean of Strasburg, with the four great dignitaries of his
chapter, on her left-hand&mdash;the rest following
higglety-pigglety as they could; some on horseback&mdash;some on
foot&mdash;some led&mdash;some driven&mdash;some down the
Rhine&mdash;some this way&mdash;some that&mdash;all set out at
sun-rise to meet the courteous stranger on the road.</p>
<p>Haste we now towards the catastrophe of my tale&mdash;I say
Catastrophe (cries Slawkenbergius) inasmuch as a tale, with parts
rightly disposed, not only rejoiceth (gaudet) in the Catastrophe
and Peripeitia of a Drama, but rejoiceth moreover in all the
essential and integrant parts of it&mdash;it has its Protasis,
Epitasis, Catastasis, its Catastrophe or Peripeitia growing one out
of the other in it, in the order Aristotle first planted
them&mdash;without which a tale had better never be told at all,
says Slawkenbergius, but be kept to a man's self.</p>
<p>In all my ten tales, in all my ten decades, have I
Slawkenbergius tied down every tale of them as tightly to this
rule, as I have done this of the stranger and his nose.</p>
<p>&mdash;From his first parley with the centinel, to his leaving
the city of Strasburg, after pulling off his crimson-sattin pair of
breeches, is the Protasis or first entrance&mdash;where the
characters of the Personae Dramatis are just touched in, and the
subject slightly begun.</p>
<p>The Epitasis, wherein the action is more fully entered upon and
heightened, till it arrives at its state or height called the
Catastasis, and which usually takes up the 2d and 3d act, is
included within that busy period of my tale, betwixt the first
night's uproar about the nose, to the conclusion of the trumpeter's
wife's lectures upon it in the middle of the grand parade: and from
the first embarking of the learned in the dispute&mdash;to the
doctors finally sailing away, and leaving the Strasburgers upon the
beach in distress, is the Catastasis or the ripening of the
incidents and passions for their bursting forth in the fifth
act.</p>
<p>This commences with the setting out of the Strasburgers in the
Frankfort road, and terminates in unwinding the labyrinth and
bringing the hero out of a state of agitation (as Aristotle calls
it) to a state of rest and quietness.</p>
<p>This, says Hafen Slawkenbergius, constitutes the Catastrophe or
Peripeitia of my tale&mdash;and that is the part of it I am going
to relate.</p>
<p>We left the stranger behind the curtain asleep&mdash;he enters
now upon the stage.</p>
<p>&mdash;What dost thou prick up thy ears at?&mdash;'tis nothing
but a man upon a horse&mdash;was the last word the stranger uttered
to his mule. It was not proper then to tell the reader, that the
mule took his master's word for it; and without any more ifs or
ands, let the traveller and his horse pass by.</p>
<p>The traveller was hastening with all diligence to get to
Strasburg that night. What a fool am I, said the traveller to
himself, when he had rode about a league farther, to think of
getting into Strasburg this night.&mdash;Strasburg!&mdash;the great
Strasburg!&mdash;Strasburg, the capital of all Alsatia! Strasburg,
an imperial city! Strasburg, a sovereign state! Strasburg,
garrisoned with five thousand of the best troops in all the
world!&mdash;Alas! if I was at the gates of Strasburg this moment,
I could not gain admittance into it for a ducat&mdash;nay a ducat
and half&mdash;'tis too much&mdash;better go back to the last inn I
have passed&mdash;than lie I know not where&mdash;or give I know
not what. The traveller, as he made these reflections in his mind,
turned his horse's head about, and three minutes after the stranger
had been conducted into his chamber, he arrived at the same
inn.</p>
<p>&mdash;We have bacon in the house, said the host, and
bread&mdash;and till eleven o'clock this night had three eggs in
it&mdash;but a stranger, who arrived an hour ago, has had them
dressed into an omelet, and we have nothing.&mdash;</p>
<p>Alas! said the traveller, harassed as I am, I want nothing but a
bed.&mdash;I have one as soft as is in Alsatia, said the host.</p>
<p>&mdash;The stranger, continued he, should have slept in it, for
'tis my best bed, but upon the score of his nose.&mdash;He has got
a defluxion, said the traveller.&mdash;Not that I know, cried the
host.&mdash;But 'tis a camp-bed, and Jacinta, said he, looking
towards the maid, imagined there was not room in it to turn his
nose in.&mdash;Why so? cried the traveller, starting back.&mdash;It
is so long a nose, replied the host.&mdash;The traveller fixed his
eyes upon Jacinta, then upon the ground&mdash;kneeled upon his
right knee&mdash;had just got his hand laid upon his
breast&mdash;Trifle not with my anxiety, said he rising up
again.&mdash;'Tis no trifle, said Jacinta, 'tis the most glorious
nose!&mdash;The traveller fell upon his knee again&mdash;laid his
hand upon his breast&mdash;then, said he, looking up to heaven,
thou hast conducted me to the end of my pilgrimage&mdash;'Tis
Diego.</p>
<p>The traveller was the brother of the Julia, so often invoked
that night by the stranger as he rode from Strasburg upon his mule;
and was come, on her part, in quest of him. He had accompanied his
sister from Valadolid across the Pyrenean mountains through France,
and had many an entangled skein to wind off in pursuit of him
through the many meanders and abrupt turnings of a lover's thorny
tracks.</p>
<p>&mdash;Julia had sunk under it&mdash;and had not been able to go
a step farther than to Lyons, where, with the many disquietudes of
a tender heart, which all talk of&mdash;but few feel&mdash;she
sicken'd, but had just strength to write a letter to Diego; and
having conjured her brother never to see her face till he had found
him out, and put the letter into his hands, Julia took to her
bed.</p>
<p>Fernandez (for that was her brother's name)&mdash;tho' the
camp-bed was as soft as any one in Alsace, yet he could not shut
his eyes in it.&mdash;As soon as it was day he rose, and hearing
Diego was risen too, he entered his chamber, and discharged his
sister's commission.</p>
<p>The letter was as follows:</p>
<p>'Seig. Diego,</p>
<p>'Whether my suspicions of your nose were justly excited or
not&mdash;'tis not now to inquire&mdash;it is enough I have not had
firmness to put them to farther tryal.</p>
<p>'How could I know so little of myself, when I sent my Duenna to
forbid your coming more under my lattice? or how could I know so
little of you, Diego, as to imagine you would not have staid one
day in Valadolid to have given ease to my doubts?&mdash;Was I to be
abandoned, Diego, because I was deceived? or was it kind to take me
at my word, whether my suspicions were just or no, and leave me, as
you did, a prey to much uncertainty and sorrow?</p>
<p>'In what manner Julia has resented this&mdash;my brother, when
he puts this letter into your hands, will tell you; He will tell
you in how few moments she repented of the rash message she had
sent you&mdash;in what frantic haste she flew to her lattice, and
how many days and nights together she leaned immoveably upon her
elbow, looking through it towards the way which Diego was wont to
come.</p>
<p>'He will tell you, when she heard of your departure&mdash;how
her spirits deserted her&mdash;how her heart sicken'd&mdash;how
piteously she mourned&mdash;how low she hung her head. O Diego! how
many weary steps has my brother's pity led me by the hand
languishing to trace out yours; how far has desire carried me
beyond strength&mdash;and how oft have I fainted by the way, and
sunk into his arms, with only power to cry out&mdash;O my
Diego!</p>
<p>'If the gentleness of your carriage has not belied your heart,
you will fly to me, almost as fast as you fled from me&mdash;haste
as you will&mdash;you will arrive but to see me expire.&mdash;'Tis
a bitter draught, Diego, but oh! 'tis embittered still more by
dying un...&mdash;'</p>
<p>She could proceed no farther.</p>
<p>Slawkenbergius supposes the word intended was unconvinced, but
her strength would not enable her to finish her letter.</p>
<p>The heart of the courteous Diego over-flowed as he read the
letter&mdash;he ordered his mule forthwith and Fernandez's horse to
be saddled; and as no vent in prose is equal to that of poetry in
such conflicts&mdash;chance, which as often directs us to remedies
as to diseases, having thrown a piece of charcoal into the
window&mdash;Diego availed himself of it, and whilst the hostler
was getting ready his mule, he eased his mind against the wall as
follows.</p>
<p>Ode.</p>
<pre>
     Harsh and untuneful are the notes of love,
     Unless my Julia strikes the key,
     Her hand alone can touch the part,
     Whose dulcet movement charms the heart,
     And governs all the man with sympathetick sway.
</pre>
<p>2d.</p>
<p>O Julia!</p>
<p>The lines were very natural&mdash;for they were nothing at all
to the purpose, says Slawkenbergius, and 'tis a pity there were no
more of them; but whether it was that Seig. Diego was slow in
composing verses&mdash;or the hostler quick in saddling
mules&mdash;is not averred; certain it was, that Diego's mule and
Fernandez's horse were ready at the door of the inn, before Diego
was ready for his second stanza; so without staying to finish his
ode, they both mounted, sallied forth, passed the Rhine, traversed
Alsace, shaped their course towards Lyons, and before the
Strasburgers and the abbess of Quedlingberg had set out on their
cavalcade, had Fernandez, Diego, and his Julia, crossed the
Pyrenean mountains, and got safe to Valadolid.</p>
<p>'Tis needless to inform the geographical reader, that when Diego
was in Spain, it was not possible to meet the courteous stranger in
the Frankfort road; it is enough to say, that of all restless
desires, curiosity being the strongest&mdash;the Strasburgers felt
the full force of it; and that for three days and nights they were
tossed to and fro in the Frankfort road, with the tempestuous fury
of this passion, before they could submit to return
home.&mdash;When alas! an event was prepared for them, of all
other, the most grievous that could befal a free people.</p>
<p>As this revolution of the Strasburgers affairs is often spoken
of, and little understood, I will, in ten words, says
Slawkenbergius, give the world an explanation of it, and with it
put an end to my tale.</p>
<p>Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy,
wrote by order of Mons. Colbert, and put in manuscript into the
hands of Lewis the fourteenth, in the year 1664.</p>
<p>'Tis as well known, that one branch out of many of that system,
was the getting possession of Strasburg, to favour an entrance at
all times into Suabia, in order to disturb the quiet of
Germany&mdash;and that in consequence of this plan, Strasburg
unhappily fell at length into their hands.</p>
<p>It is the lot of a few to trace out the true springs of this and
such like revolutions&mdash;The vulgar look too high for
them&mdash;Statesmen look too low&mdash;Truth (for once) lies in
the middle.</p>
<p>What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city! cries
one historian&mdash;The Strasburgers deemed it a diminution of
their freedom to receive an imperial garrison&mdash;so fell a prey
to a French one.</p>
<p>The fate, says another, of the Strasburgers, may be a warning to
all free people to save their money.&mdash;They anticipated their
revenues&mdash;brought themselves under taxes, exhausted their
strength, and in the end became so weak a people, they had not
strength to keep their gates shut, and so the French pushed them
open.</p>
<p>Alas! alas! cries Slawkenbergius, 'twas not the
French,&mdash;'twas Curiosity pushed them open&mdash;The French
indeed, who are ever upon the catch, when they saw the
Strasburgers, men, women and children, all marched out to follow
the stranger's nose&mdash;each man followed his own, and marched
in.</p>
<p>Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down
ever since&mdash;but not from any cause which commercial heads have
assigned; for it is owing to this only, that Noses have ever so run
in their heads, that the Strasburgers could not follow their
business.</p>
<p>Alas! alas! cries Slawkenbergius, making an exclamation&mdash;it
is not the first&mdash;and I fear will not be the last fortress
that has been either won&mdash;or lost by Noses.</p>
<p>The End of Slawkenbergius's Tale.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXVI.</h2>
<p>With all this learning upon Noses running perpetually in my
father's fancy&mdash;with so many family prejudices&mdash;and ten
decades of such tales running on for ever along with them&mdash;how
was it possible with such exquisite&mdash;was it a true
nose?&mdash;That a man with such exquisite feelings as my father
had, could bear the shock at all below stairs&mdash;or indeed above
stairs, in any other posture, but the very posture I have
described?</p>
<p>&mdash;Throw yourself down upon the bed, a dozen
times&mdash;taking care only to place a looking-glass first in a
chair on one side of it, before you do it&mdash;But was the
stranger's nose a true nose, or was it a false one?</p>
<p>To tell that before-hand, madam, would be to do injury to one of
the best tales in the Christian-world; and that is the tenth of the
tenth decade, which immediately follows this.</p>
<p>This tale, cried Slawkenbergius, somewhat exultingly, has been
reserved by me for the concluding tale of my whole work; knowing
right well, that when I shall have told it, and my reader shall
have read it thro'&mdash;'twould be even high time for both of us
to shut up the book; inasmuch, continues Slawkenbergius, as I know
of no tale which could possibly ever go down after it.</p>
<p>'Tis a tale indeed!</p>
<p>This sets out with the first interview in the inn at Lyons, when
Fernandez left the courteous stranger and his sister Julia alone in

<p>The Intricacies of Diego and Julia.</p>
<p>Heavens! thou art a strange creature, Slawkenbergius! what a
whimsical view of the involutions of the heart of woman hast thou
opened! how this can ever be translated, and yet if this specimen
of Slawkenbergius's tales, and the exquisitiveness of his moral,
should please the world&mdash;translated shall a couple of volumes
be.&mdash;Else, how this can ever be translated into good English,
I have no sort of conception&mdash;There seems in some passages to
want a sixth sense to do it rightly.&mdash;What can he mean by the
lambent pupilability of slow, low, dry chat, five notes below the
natural tone&mdash;which you know, madam, is little more than a
whisper? The moment I pronounced the words, I could perceive an
attempt towards a vibration in the strings, about the region of the
heart.&mdash;The brain made no acknowledgment.&mdash;There's often
no good understanding betwixt 'em&mdash;I felt as if I understood
it.&mdash;I had no ideas.&mdash;The movement could not be without
cause.&mdash;I'm lost. I can make nothing of it&mdash;unless, may
it please your worships, the voice, in that case being little more
than a whisper, unavoidably forces the eyes to approach not only
within six inches of each other&mdash;but to look into the
pupils&mdash;is not that dangerous?&mdash;But it can't be
avoided&mdash;for to look up to the cieling, in that case the two
chins unavoidably meet&mdash;and to look down into each other's
lap, the foreheads come to immediate contact, which at once puts an
end to the conference&mdash;I mean to the sentimental part of
it.&mdash;What is left, madam, is not worth stooping for.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XXXVII.</h2>
<p>My father lay stretched across the bed as still as if the hand
of death had pushed him down, for a full hour and a half before he
began to play upon the floor with the toe of that foot which hung
over the bed-side; my uncle Toby's heart was a pound lighter for
it.&mdash;In a few moments, his left-hand, the knuckles of which
had all the time reclined upon the handle of the chamber-pot, came
to its feeling&mdash;he thrust it a little more within the
valance&mdash;drew up his hand, when he had done, into his
bosom&mdash;gave a hem! My good uncle Toby, with infinite pleasure,
answered it; and full gladly would have ingrafted a sentence of
consolation upon the opening it afforded: but having no talents, as
I said, that way, and fearing moreover that he might set out with
something which might make a bad matter worse, he contented himself
with resting his chin placidly upon the cross of his crutch.</p>
<p>Now whether the compression shortened my uncle Toby's face into
a more pleasurable oval&mdash;or that the philanthropy of his
heart, in seeing his brother beginning to emerge out of the sea of
his afflictions, had braced up his muscles&mdash;so that the
compression upon his chin only doubled the benignity which was
there before, is not hard to decide.&mdash;My father, in turning
his eyes, was struck with such a gleam of sun-shine in his face, as
melted down the sullenness of his grief in a moment.</p>
<p>He broke silence as follows:</p>

<p>Did ever man, brother Toby, cried my father, raising himself
upon his elbow, and turning himself round to the opposite side of
the bed, where my uncle Toby was sitting in his old fringed chair,
with his chin resting upon his crutch&mdash;did ever a poor
unfortunate man, brother Toby, cried my father, receive so many
lashes?&mdash;The most I ever saw given, quoth my uncle Toby
(ringing the bell at the bed's head for Trim) was to a grenadier, I
think in Mackay's regiment.</p>
<p>&mdash;Had my uncle Toby shot a bullet through my father's
heart, he could not have fallen down with his nose upon the quilt
more suddenly.</p>
<p>Bless me! said my uncle Toby.</p>

<p>Was it Mackay's regiment, quoth my uncle Toby, where the poor
grenadier was so unmercifully whipp'd at Bruges about the
ducats?&mdash;O Christ! he was innocent! cried Trim, with a deep
sigh.&mdash;And he was whipp'd, may it please your honour, almost
to death's door.&mdash;They had better have shot him outright, as
he begg'd, and he had gone directly to heaven, for he was as
innocent as your honour.&mdash;I thank thee, Trim, quoth my uncle
Toby.&mdash;I never think of his, continued Trim, and my poor
brother Tom's misfortunes, for we were all three school-fellows,
but I cry like a coward.&mdash;Tears are no proof of cowardice,
Trim.&mdash;I drop them oft-times myself, cried my uncle
Toby.&mdash;I know your honour does, replied Trim, and so am not
ashamed of it myself.&mdash;But to think, may it please your
honour, continued Trim, a tear stealing into the corner of his eye
as he spoke&mdash;to think of two virtuous lads with hearts as warm
in their bodies, and as honest as God could make them&mdash;the
children of honest people, going forth with gallant spirits to seek
their fortunes in the world&mdash;and fall into such
evils!&mdash;poor Tom! to be tortured upon a rack for
nothing&mdash;but marrying a Jew's widow who sold
sausages&mdash;honest Dick Johnson's soul to be scourged out of his
body, for the ducats another man put into his
knapsack!&mdash;O!&mdash;these are misfortunes, cried
Trim,&mdash;pulling out his handkerchief&mdash;these are
misfortunes, may it please your honour, worth lying down and crying
over.</p>
<p>&mdash;My father could not help blushing.</p>
<p>'Twould be a pity, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, thou shouldst ever
feel sorrow of thy own&mdash;thou feelest it so tenderly for
others.&mdash;Alack-o-day, replied the corporal, brightening up his
face&mdash;your honour knows I have neither wife or child&mdash;I
can have no sorrows in this world.&mdash;My father could not help
smiling.&mdash;As few as any man, Trim, replied my uncle Toby; nor
can I see how a fellow of thy light heart can suffer, but from the
distress of poverty in thy old age&mdash;when thou art passed all
services, Trim&mdash;and hast outlived thy friends.&mdash;An'
please your honour, never fear, replied Trim, chearily.&mdash;But I
would have thee never fear, Trim, replied my uncle Toby, and
therefore, continued my uncle Toby, throwing down his crutch, and
getting up upon his legs as he uttered the word therefore&mdash;in
recompence, Trim, of thy long fidelity to me, and that goodness of
thy heart I have had such proofs of&mdash;whilst thy master is
worth a shilling&mdash;thou shalt never ask elsewhere, Trim, for a
penny. Trim attempted to thank my uncle Toby&mdash;but had not
power&mdash;tears trickled down his cheeks faster than he could
wipe them off&mdash;He laid his hands upon his breast&mdash;made a
bow to the ground, and shut the door.</p>
<p>&mdash;I have left Trim my bowling-green, cried my uncle
Toby&mdash;My father smiled.&mdash;I have left him moreover a
pension, continued my uncle Toby.&mdash;My father looked grave.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XLI.</h2>
<p>When my uncle Toby first mentioned the grenadier, my father, I
said, fell down with his nose flat to the quilt, and as suddenly as
if my uncle Toby had shot him; but it was not added that every
other limb and member of my father instantly relapsed with his nose
into the same precise attitude in which he lay first described; so
that when corporal Trim left the room, and my father found himself
disposed to rise off the bed&mdash;he had all the little
preparatory movements to run over again, before he could do it.
Attitudes are nothing, madam&mdash;'tis the transition from one
attitude to another&mdash;like the preparation and resolution of
the discord into harmony, which is all in all.</p>
<p>For which reason my father played the same jig over again with
his toe upon the floor&mdash;pushed the chamber-pot still a little
farther within the valance&mdash;gave a hem&mdash;raised himself up
upon his elbow&mdash;and was just beginning to address himself to
my uncle Toby&mdash;when recollecting the unsuccessfulness of his
first effort in that attitude&mdash;he got upon his legs, and in
making the third turn across the room, he stopped short before my
uncle Toby; and laying the three first fingers of his right-hand in
the palm of his left, and stooping a little, he addressed himself
to my uncle Toby as follows:</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XLII.</h2>
<p>When I reflect, brother Toby, upon Man; and take a view of that
dark side of him which represents his life as open to so many
causes of trouble&mdash;when I consider, brother Toby, how oft we
eat the bread of affliction, and that we are born to it, as to the
portion of our inheritance&mdash;I was born to nothing, quoth my
uncle Toby, interrupting my father&mdash;but my commission. Zooks!
said my father, did not my uncle leave you a hundred and twenty
pounds a year?&mdash;What could I have done without it? replied my
uncle Toby&mdash;That's another concern, said my father
testily&mdash;But I say Toby, when one runs over the catalogue of
all the cross-reckonings and sorrowful Items with which the heart
of man is overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the
mind is enabled to stand out, and bear itself up, as it does,
against the impositions laid upon our nature.&mdash;'Tis by the
assistance of Almighty God, cried my uncle Toby, looking up, and
pressing the palms of his hands close together&mdash;'tis not from
our own strength, brother Shandy&mdash;a centinel in a wooden
centry-box might as well pretend to stand it out against a
detachment of fifty men.&mdash;We are upheld by the grace and the
assistance of the best of Beings.</p>
<p>&mdash;That is cutting the knot, said my father, instead of
untying it,&mdash;But give me leave to lead you, brother Toby, a
little deeper into the mystery.</p>
<p>With all my heart, replied my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that
in which Socrates is so finely painted by Raffael in his school of
Athens; which your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely
imagined, that even the particular manner of the reasoning of
Socrates is expressed by it&mdash;for he holds the fore-finger of
his left-hand between the fore-finger and the thumb of his right,
and seems as if he was saying to the libertine he is
reclaiming&mdash;'You grant me this&mdash;and this: and this, and
this, I don't ask of you&mdash;they follow of themselves in
course.'</p>
<p>So stood my father, holding fast his fore-finger betwixt his
finger and his thumb, and reasoning with my uncle Toby as he sat in
his old fringed chair, valanced around with party-coloured worsted
bobs&mdash;O Garrick!&mdash;what a rich scene of this would thy
exquisite powers make! and how gladly would I write such another to
avail myself of thy immortality, and secure my own behind it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XLIII.</h2>
<p>Though man is of all others the most curious vehicle, said my
father, yet at the same time 'tis of so slight a frame, and so
totteringly put together, that the sudden jerks and hard jostlings
it unavoidably meets with in this rugged journey, would overset and
tear it to pieces a dozen times a day&mdash;was it not, brother
Toby, that there is a secret spring within us.&mdash;Which spring,
said my uncle Toby, I take to be Religion.&mdash;Will that set my
child's nose on? cried my father, letting go his finger, and
striking one hand against the other.&mdash;It makes every thing
straight for us, answered my uncle Toby.&mdash;Figuratively
speaking, dear Toby, it may, for aught I know, said my father; but
the spring I am speaking of, is that great and elastic power within
us of counterbalancing evil, which, like a secret spring in a
well-ordered machine, though it can't prevent the shock&mdash;at
least it imposes upon our sense of it.</p>
<p>Now, my dear brother, said my father, replacing his fore-finger,
as he was coming closer to the point&mdash;had my child arrived
safe into the world, unmartyr'd in that precious part of
him&mdash;fanciful and extravagant as I may appear to the world in
my opinion of christian names, and of that magic bias which good or
bad names irresistibly impress upon our characters and
conducts&mdash;Heaven is witness! that in the warmest transports of
my wishes for the prosperity of my child, I never once wished to
crown his head with more glory and honour than what George or
Edward would have spread around it.</p>
<p>But alas! continued my father, as the greatest evil has befallen
him&mdash;I must counteract and undo it with the greatest good.</p>
<p>He shall be christened Trismegistus, brother.</p>
<p>I wish it may answer&mdash;replied my uncle Toby, rising up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XLIV.</h2>
<p>What a chapter of chances, said my father, turning himself about
upon the first landing, as he and my uncle Toby were going down
stairs, what a long chapter of chances do the events of this world
lay open to us! Take pen and ink in hand, brother Toby, and
calculate it fairly&mdash;I know no more of calculation than this
balluster, said my uncle Toby (striking short of it with his
crutch, and hitting my father a desperate blow souse upon his
shin-bone)&mdash;'Twas a hundred to one-cried my uncle Toby&mdash;I
thought, quoth my father, (rubbing his shin) you had known nothing
of calculations, brother Toby. A mere chance, said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;Then it adds one to the chapter&mdash;replied my
father.</p>
<p>The double success of my father's repartees tickled off the pain
of his shin at once&mdash;it was well it so fell out&mdash;(chance!
again)&mdash;or the world to this day had never known the subject
of my father's calculation&mdash;to guess it&mdash;there was no
chance&mdash;What a lucky chapter of chances has this turned out!
for it has saved me the trouble of writing one express, and in
truth I have enough already upon my hands without it.&mdash;Have
not I promised the world a chapter of knots? two chapters upon the
right and the wrong end of a woman? a chapter upon whiskers? a
chapter upon wishes?&mdash;a chapter of noses?&mdash;No, I have
done that&mdash;a chapter upon my uncle Toby's modesty? to say
nothing of a chapter upon chapters, which I will finish before I
sleep&mdash;by my great grandfather's whiskers, I shall never get
half of 'em through this year.</p>
<p>Take pen and ink in hand, and calculate it fairly, brother Toby,
said my father, and it will turn out a million to one, that of all
the parts of the body, the edge of the forceps should have the ill
luck just to fall upon and break down that one part, which should
break down the fortunes of our house with it.</p>
<p>It might have been worse, replied my uncle Toby.&mdash;I don't
comprehend, said my father.&mdash;Suppose the hip had presented,
replied my uncle Toby, as Dr. Slop foreboded.</p>
<p>My father reflected half a minute&mdash;looked
down&mdash;touched the middle of his forehead slightly with his
finger&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;True, said he.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.XLV.</h2>
<p>Is it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going
down one pair of stairs? for we are got no farther yet than to the
first landing, and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom;
and for aught I know, as my father and my uncle Toby are in a
talking humour, there may be as many chapters as steps:&mdash;let
that be as it will, Sir, I can no more help it than my
destiny:&mdash;A sudden impulse comes across me&mdash;drop the
curtain, Shandy&mdash;I drop it&mdash;Strike a line here across the
paper, Tristram&mdash;I strike it&mdash;and hey for a new
chapter.</p>
<p>The deuce of any other rule have I to govern myself by in this
affair&mdash;and if I had one&mdash;as I do all things out of all
rule&mdash;I would twist it and tear it to pieces, and throw it
into the fire when I had done&mdash;Am I warm? I am, and the cause
demands it&mdash;a pretty story! is a man to follow rules&mdash;or
rules to follow him?</p>
<p>Now this, you must know, being my chapter upon chapters, which I
promised to write before I went to sleep, I thought it meet to ease
my conscience entirely before I laid down, by telling the world all
I knew about the matter at once: Is not this ten times better than
to set out dogmatically with a sententious parade of wisdom, and
telling the world a story of a roasted horse&mdash;that chapters
relieve the mind&mdash;that they assist&mdash;or impose upon the
imagination&mdash;and that in a work of this dramatic cast they are
as necessary as the shifting of scenes&mdash;with fifty other cold
conceits, enough to extinguish the fire which roasted him?&mdash;O!
but to understand this, which is a puff at the fire of Diana's
temple&mdash;you must read Longinus&mdash;read away&mdash;if you
are not a jot the wiser by reading him the first time
over&mdash;never fear&mdash;read him again&mdash;Avicenna and
Licetus read Aristotle's metaphysicks forty times through a-piece,
and never understood a single word.&mdash;But mark the
consequence&mdash;Avicenna turned out a desperate writer at all
kinds of writing&mdash;for he wrote books de omni scribili; and for
Licetus (Fortunio) though all the world knows he was born a foetus,
(Ce Foetus n'etoit pas plus grand que la paume de la main; mais son
pere l'ayant examine en qualite de Medecin, &amp; ayant trouve que
c'etoit quelque chose de plus qu'un Embryon, le fit transporter
tout vivant a Rapallo, ou il le fit voir a Jerome Bardi &amp; a
d'autres Medecins du lieu. On trouva qu'il ne lui manquoit rien
d'essentiel a la vie; &amp; son pere pour faire voir un essai de
son experience, entreprit d'achever l'ouvrage de la Nature, &amp;
de travailler a la formation de l'Enfant avec le meme artifice que
celui dont on se sert pour faire ecclorre les Poulets en Egypte. Il
instruisit une Nourisse de tout ce qu'elle avoit a faire, &amp;
ayant fait mettre son fils dans un pour proprement accommode, il
reussit a l'elever &amp; a lui faire prendre ses accroissemens
necessaires, par l'uniformite d'une chaleur etrangere mesuree
exactement sur les degres d'un Thermometre, ou d'un autre
instrument equivalent. (Vide Mich. Giustinian, ne gli Scritt.
Liguri a 223. 488.) On auroit toujours ete tres satisfait de
l'industrie d'un pere si experimente dans l'Art de la Generation,
quand il n'auroit pu prolonger la vie a son fils que pour Puelques
mois, ou pour peu d'annees. Mais quand on se represente que
l'Enfant a vecu pres de quatre-vingts ans, &amp; qu'il a compose
quatre-vingts Ouvrages differents tous fruits d'une longue
lecture&mdash;il faut convenir que tout ce qui est incroyable n'est
pas toujours faux, &amp; que la Vraisemblance n'est pas toujours du
cote la Verite. Il n'avoit que dix neuf ans lorsqu'il composa
Gonopsychanthropologia de Origine Animae humanae. (Les Enfans
celebres, revus &amp; corriges par M. de la Monnoye de l'Academie
Francoise.)) of no more than five inches and a half in length, yet
he grew to that astonishing height in literature, as to write a
book with a title as long as himself&mdash;the learned know I mean
his Gonopsychanthropologia, upon the origin of the human soul.</p>
<p>So much for my chapter upon chapters, which I hold to be the
best chapter in my whole work; and take my word, whoever reads it,
is full as well employed, as in picking straws.</p>

<p>&mdash;And how does your mistress? cried my father, taking the
same step over again from the landing, and calling to Susannah,
whom he saw passing by the foot of the stairs with a huge
pin-cushion in her hand&mdash;how does your mistress? As well, said
Susannah, tripping by, but without looking up, as can be
expected.&mdash;What a fool am I! said my father, drawing his leg
back again&mdash;let things be as they will, brother Toby, 'tis
ever the precise answer&mdash;And how is the child, pray?&mdash;No
answer. And where is Dr. Slop? added my father, raising his voice
aloud, and looking over the ballusters&mdash;Susannah was out of
hearing.</p>
<p>Of all the riddles of a married life, said my father, crossing
the landing in order to set his back against the wall, whilst he
propounded it to my uncle Toby&mdash;of all the puzzling riddles,
said he, in a marriage state,&mdash;of which you may trust me,
brother Toby, there are more asses loads than all Job's stock of
asses could have carried&mdash;there is not one that has more
intricacies in it than this&mdash;that from the very moment the
mistress of the house is brought to bed, every female in it, from
my lady's gentlewoman down to the cinder-wench, becomes an inch
taller for it; and give themselves more airs upon that single inch,
than all their other inches put together.</p>
<p>I think rather, replied my uncle Toby, that 'tis we who sink an
inch lower.&mdash;If I meet but a woman with child&mdash;I do
it.&mdash;'Tis a heavy tax upon that half of our fellow-creatures,
brother Shandy, said my uncle Toby&mdash;'Tis a piteous burden upon
'em, continued he, shaking his head&mdash;Yes, yes, 'tis a painful
thing&mdash;said my father, shaking his head too&mdash;but
certainly since shaking of heads came into fashion, never did two
heads shake together, in concert, from two such different

very willing to give any one of 'em a crown to help me with his
tackling, to get my father and my uncle Toby off the stairs, and to
put them to bed.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis even high time; for except a short nap, which they
both got whilst Trim was boring the jack-boots&mdash;and which,
by-the-bye, did my father no sort of good, upon the score of the
bad hinge&mdash;they have not else shut their eyes, since nine

twelve-month; and having got, as you perceive, almost into the
middle of my third volume (According to the preceding
Editions.)&mdash;and no farther than to my first day's
life&mdash;'tis demonstrative that I have three hundred and
sixty-four days more life to write just now, than when I first set
out; so that instead of advancing, as a common writer, in my work
with what I have been doing at it&mdash;on the contrary, I am just
thrown so many volumes back&mdash;was every day of my life to be as
busy a day as this&mdash;And why not?&mdash;and the transactions
and opinions of it to take up as much description&mdash;And for
what reason should they be cut short? as at this rate I should just
live 364 times faster than I should write&mdash;It must follow, an'
please your worships, that the more I write, the more I shall have
to write&mdash;and consequently, the more your worships read, the
more your worships will have to read.</p>
<p>Will this be good for your worships eyes?</p>
<p>It will do well for mine; and, was it not that my Opinions will
be the death of me, I perceive I shall lead a fine life of it out
of this self-same life of mine; or, in other words, shall lead a
couple of fine lives together.</p>
<p>As for the proposal of twelve volumes a year, or a volume a
month, it no way alters my prospect&mdash;write as I will, and rush
as I may into the middle of things, as Horace advises&mdash;I shall
never overtake myself whipp'd and driven to the last pinch; at the
worst I shall have one day the start of my pen&mdash;and one day is
enough for two volumes&mdash;and two volumes will be enough for one
year.&mdash;</p>
<p>Heaven prosper the manufacturers of paper under this propitious
reign, which is now opened to us&mdash;as I trust its providence

<p>&mdash;Then reach me my breeches off the chair, said my father
to Susannah.&mdash;There is not a moment's time to dress you, Sir,
cried Susannah&mdash;the child is as black in the face as
my&mdash;As your what? said my father, for like all orators, he was
a dear searcher into comparisons.&mdash;Bless, me, Sir, said
Susannah, the child's in a fit.&mdash;And where's Mr.
Yorick?&mdash;Never where he should be, said Susannah, but his
curate's in the dressing-room, with the child upon his arm, waiting
for the name&mdash;and my mistress bid me run as fast as I could to
know, as captain Shandy is the godfather, whether it should not be
called after him.</p>
<p>Were one sure, said my father to himself, scratching his
eye-brow, that the child was expiring, one might as well compliment
my brother Toby as not&mdash;and it would be a pity, in such a
case, to throw away so great a name as Trismegistus upon
him&mdash;but he may recover.</p>
<p>No, no,&mdash;said my father to Susannah, I'll get
up&mdash;There is no time, cried Susannah, the child's as black as
my shoe. Trismegistus, said my father&mdash;But stay&mdash;thou art
a leaky vessel, Susannah, added my father; canst thou carry
Trismegistus in thy head, the length of the gallery without
scattering?&mdash;Can I? cried Susannah, shutting the door in a
huff.&mdash;If she can, I'll be shot, said my father, bouncing out
of bed in the dark, and groping for his breeches.</p>
<p>Susannah ran with all speed along the gallery.</p>
<p>My father made all possible speed to find his breeches.</p>
<p>Susannah got the start, and kept it&mdash;'Tis
Tris&mdash;something, cried Susannah&mdash;There is no
christian-name in the world, said the curate, beginning with
Tris&mdash;but Tristram. Then 'tis Tristram-gistus, quoth
Susannah.</p>
<p>&mdash;There is no gistus to it, noodle!&mdash;'tis my own name,
replied the curate, dipping his hand, as he spoke, into the
bason&mdash;Tristram! said he, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;so Tristram was I called, and Tristram shall I be to
the day of my death.</p>
<p>My father followed Susannah, with his night-gown across his arm,
with nothing more than his breeches on, fastened through haste with
but a single button, and that button through haste thrust only half
into the button-hole.</p>
<p>&mdash;She has not forgot the name, cried my father, half
opening the door?&mdash;No, no, said the curate, with a tone of
intelligence.&mdash;And the child is better, cried
Susannah.&mdash;And how does your mistress? As well, said Susannah,
as can be expected.&mdash;Pish! said my father, the button of his
breeches slipping out of the button-hole&mdash;So that whether the
interjection was levelled at Susannah, or the
button-hole&mdash;whether Pish was an interjection of contempt or
an interjection of modesty, is a doubt, and must be a doubt till I
shall have time to write the three following favourite chapters,
that is, my chapter of chamber-maids, my chapter of pishes, and my
chapter of button-holes.</p>
<p>All the light I am able to give the reader at present is this,
that the moment my father cried Pish! he whisk'd himself
about&mdash;and with his breeches held up by one hand, and his
night-gown thrown across the arm of the other, he turned along the
gallery to bed, something slower than he came.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.L.</h2>
<h3>I wish I could write a chapter upon sleep.</h3>
<p>A fitter occasion could never have presented itself, than what
this moment offers, when all the curtains of the family are
drawn&mdash;the candles put out&mdash;and no creature's eyes are
open but a single one, for the other has been shut these twenty
years, of my mother's nurse.</p>
<p>It is a fine subject.</p>
<p>And yet, as fine as it is, I would undertake to write a dozen
chapters upon button-holes, both quicker and with more fame, than a
single chapter upon this.</p>
<p>Button-holes! there is something lively in the very idea of
'em&mdash;and trust me, when I get amongst 'em&mdash;You gentry
with great beards&mdash;look as grave as you will&mdash;I'll make
merry work with my button-holes&mdash;I shall have 'em all to
myself&mdash;'tis a maiden subject&mdash;I shall run foul of no
man's wisdom or fine sayings in it.</p>
<p>But for sleep&mdash;I know I shall make nothing of it before I
begin&mdash;I am no dab at your fine sayings in the first
place&mdash;and in the next, I cannot for my soul set a grave face
upon a bad matter, and tell the world&mdash;'tis the refuge of the
unfortunate&mdash;the enfranchisement of the prisoner&mdash;the
downy lap of the hopeless, the weary, and the broken-hearted; nor
could I set out with a lye in my mouth, by affirming, that of all
the soft and delicious functions of our nature, by which the great
Author of it, in his bounty, has been pleased to recompence the
sufferings wherewith his justice and his good pleasure has wearied
us&mdash;that this is the chiefest (I know pleasures worth ten of
it); or what a happiness it is to man, when the anxieties and
passions of the day are over, and he lies down upon his back, that
his soul shall be so seated within him, that whichever way she
turns her eyes, the heavens shall look calm and sweet above
her&mdash;no desire&mdash;or fear&mdash;or doubt that troubles the
air, nor any difficulty past, present, or to come, that the
imagination may not pass over without offence, in that sweet
secession.</p>
<p>'God's blessing,' said Sancho Panca, 'be upon the man who first
invented this self-same thing called sleep&mdash;it covers a man
all over like a cloak.' Now there is more to me in this, and it
speaks warmer to my heart and affections, than all the
dissertations squeez'd out of the heads of the learned together
upon the subject.</p>
<p>&mdash;Not that I altogether disapprove of what Montaigne
advances upon it&mdash;'tis admirable in its way&mdash;(I quote by
memory.)</p>
<p>The world enjoys other pleasures, says he, as they do that of
sleep, without tasting or feeling it as it slips and passes
by.&mdash;We should study and ruminate upon it, in order to render
proper thanks to him who grants it to us.&mdash;For this end I
cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep, that I may the better and
more sensibly relish it.&mdash;And yet I see few, says he again,
who live with less sleep, when need requires; my body is capable of
a firm, but not of a violent and sudden agitation&mdash;I evade of
late all violent exercises&mdash;I am never weary with
walking&mdash;but from my youth, I never looked to ride upon
pavements. I love to lie hard and alone, and even without my
wife&mdash;This last word may stagger the faith of the
world&mdash;but remember, 'La Vraisemblance' (as Bayle says in the
affair of Liceti) 'n'est pas toujours du Cote de la Verite.' And so
much for sleep.</p>

<p>If my wife will but venture him&mdash;brother Toby, Trismegistus
shall be dress'd and brought down to us, whilst you and I are
getting our breakfasts together.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Go, tell Susannah, Obadiah, to step here.</p>
<p>She is run up stairs, answered Obadiah, this very instant,
sobbing and crying, and wringing her hands as if her heart would
break.</p>
<p>We shall have a rare month of it, said my father, turning his
head from Obadiah, and looking wistfully in my uncle Toby's face
for some time&mdash;we shall have a devilish month of it, brother
Toby, said my father, setting his arms a'kimbo, and shaking his
head; fire, water, women, wind&mdash;brother Toby!&mdash;'Tis some
misfortune, quoth my uncle Toby.&mdash;That it is, cried my
father&mdash;to have so many jarring elements breaking loose, and
riding triumph in every corner of a gentleman's house&mdash;Little
boots it to the peace of a family, brother Toby, that you and I
possess ourselves, and sit here silent and unmoved&mdash;whilst
such a storm is whistling over our heads.&mdash;</p>
<p>And what's the matter, Susannah? They have called the child
Tristram&mdash;and my mistress is just got out of an hysterick fit
about it&mdash;No!&mdash;'tis not my fault, said Susannah&mdash;I
told him it was Tristram-gistus.</p>
<p>&mdash;Make tea for yourself, brother Toby, said my father,
taking down his hat&mdash;but how different from the sallies and
agitations of voice and members which a common reader would
imagine!</p>
<p>&mdash;For he spake in the sweetest modulation&mdash;and took
down his hat with the genteelest movement of limbs, that ever
affliction harmonized and attuned together.</p>
<p>&mdash;Go to the bowling-green for corporal Trim, said my uncle
Toby, speaking to Obadiah, as soon as my father left the room.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LII.</h2>
<p>When the misfortune of my Nose fell so heavily upon my father's
head;&mdash;the reader remembers that he walked instantly up
stairs, and cast himself down upon his bed; and from hence, unless
he has a great insight into human nature, he will be apt to expect
a rotation of the same ascending and descending movements from him,
upon this misfortune of my Name;&mdash;no.</p>
<p>The different weight, dear Sir&mdash;nay even the different
package of two vexations of the same weight&mdash;makes a very wide
difference in our manner of bearing and getting through with
them.&mdash;It is not half an hour ago, when (in the great hurry
and precipitation of a poor devil's writing for daily bread) I
threw a fair sheet, which I had just finished, and carefully wrote
out, slap into the fire, instead of the foul one.</p>
<p>Instantly I snatch'd off my wig, and threw it perpendicularly,
with all imaginable violence, up to the top of the
room&mdash;indeed I caught it as it fell&mdash;but there was an end
of the matter; nor do I think any think else in Nature would have
given such immediate ease: She, dear Goddess, by an instantaneous
impulse, in all provoking cases, determines us to a sally of this
or that member&mdash;or else she thrusts us into this or that
place, or posture of body, we know not why&mdash;But mark, madam,
we live amongst riddles and mysteries&mdash;the most obvious
things, which come in our way, have dark sides, which the quickest
sight cannot penetrate into; and even the clearest and most exalted
understandings amongst us find ourselves puzzled and at a loss in
almost every cranny of nature's works: so that this, like a
thousand other things, falls out for us in a way, which tho' we
cannot reason upon it&mdash;yet we find the good of it, may it
please your reverences and your worships&mdash;and that's enough
for us.</p>
<p>Now, my father could not lie down with this affliction for his
life&mdash;nor could he carry it up stairs like the other&mdash;he
walked composedly out with it to the fish-pond.</p>
<p>Had my father leaned his head upon his hand, and reasoned an
hour which way to have gone&mdash;reason, with all her force, could
not have directed him to any think like it: there is something,
Sir, in fish-ponds&mdash;but what it is, I leave to system-builders
and fish-pond-diggers betwixt 'em to find out&mdash;but there is
something, under the first disorderly transport of the humours, so
unaccountably becalming in an orderly and a sober walk towards one
of them, that I have often wondered that neither Pythagoras, nor
Plato, nor Solon, nor Lycurgus, nor Mahomet, nor any one of your
noted lawgivers, ever gave order about them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LIII.</h2>
<p>Your honour, said Trim, shutting the parlour-door before he
began to speak, has heard, I imagine, of this unlucky
accident&mdash;O yes, Trim, said my uncle Toby, and it gives me
great concern.&mdash;I am heartily concerned too, but I hope your
honour, replied Trim, will do me the justice to believe, that it
was not in the least owing to me.&mdash;To
thee&mdash;Trim?&mdash;cried my uncle Toby, looking kindly in his
face&mdash;'twas Susannah's and the curate's folly betwixt
them.&mdash;What business could they have together, an' please your
honour, in the garden?&mdash;In the gallery thou meanest, replied
my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>Trim found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a
low bow&mdash;Two misfortunes, quoth the corporal to himself, are
twice as many at least as are needful to be talked over at one
time;&mdash;the mischief the cow has done in breaking into the
fortifications, may be told his honour hereafter.&mdash;Trim's
casuistry and address, under the cover of his low bow, prevented
all suspicion in my uncle Toby, so he went on with what he had to
say to Trim as follows:</p>
<p>&mdash;For my own part, Trim, though I can see little or no
difference betwixt my nephew's being called Tristram or
Trismegistus&mdash;yet as the thing sits so near my brother's
heart, Trim&mdash;I would freely have given a hundred pounds rather
than it should have happened.&mdash;A hundred pounds, an' please
your honour! replied Trim,&mdash;I would not give a cherry-stone to
boot.&mdash;Nor would I, Trim, upon my own account, quoth my uncle
Toby&mdash;but my brother, whom there is no arguing with in this
case&mdash;maintains that a great deal more depends, Trim, upon
christian-names, than what ignorant people imagine&mdash;for he
says there never was a great or heroic action performed since the
world began by one called Tristram&mdash;nay, he will have it,
Trim, that a man can neither be learned, or wise, or
brave.&mdash;'Tis all fancy, an' please your honour&mdash;I fought
just as well, replied the corporal, when the regiment called me
Trim, as when they called me James Butler.&mdash;And for my own
part, said my uncle Toby, though I should blush to boast of myself,
Trim&mdash;yet had my name been Alexander, I could have done no
more at Namur than my duty.&mdash;Bless your honour! cried Trim,
advancing three steps as he spoke, does a man think of his
christian-name when he goes upon the attack?&mdash;Or when he
stands in the trench, Trim? cried my uncle Toby, looking
firm.&mdash;Or when he enters a breach? said Trim, pushing in
between two chairs.&mdash;Or forces the lines? cried my uncle,
rising up, and pushing his crutch like a pike.&mdash;Or facing a
platoon? cried Trim, presenting his stick like a firelock.&mdash;Or
when he marches up the glacis? cried my uncle Toby, looking warm
and setting his foot upon his stool.&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LIV.</h2>
<p>My father was returned from his walk to the fish-pond&mdash;and
opened the parlour-door in the very height of the attack, just as
my uncle Toby was marching up the glacis&mdash;Trim recovered his
arms&mdash;never was my uncle Toby caught in riding at such a
desperate rate in his life! Alas! my uncle Toby! had not a
weightier matter called forth all the ready eloquence of my
father&mdash;how hadst thou then and thy poor Hobby-Horse too been
insulted!</p>
<p>My father hung up his hat with the same air he took it down; and
after giving a slight look at the disorder of the room, he took
hold of one of the chairs which had formed the corporal's breach,
and placing it over-against my uncle Toby, he sat down in it, and
as soon as the tea-things were taken away, and the door shut, he
broke out in a lamentation as follows:</p>
<p>My Father's Lamentation.</p>
<p>It is in vain longer, said my father, addressing himself as much
to Ernulphus's curse, which was laid upon the corner of the
chimney-piece&mdash;as to my uncle Toby who sat under it&mdash;it
is in vain longer, said my father, in the most querulous monotony
imaginable, to struggle as I have done against this most
uncomfortable of human persuasions&mdash;I see it plainly, that
either for my own sins, brother Toby, or the sins and follies of
the Shandy family, Heaven has thought fit to draw forth the
heaviest of its artillery against me; and that the prosperity of my
child is the point upon which the whole force of it is directed to
play.&mdash;Such a thing would batter the whole universe about our
ears, brother Shandy, said my uncle Toby&mdash;if it was so-Unhappy
Tristram! child of wrath! child of decrepitude! interruption!
mistake! and discontent! What one misfortune or disaster in the
book of embryotic evils, that could unmechanize thy frame, or
entangle thy filaments! which has not fallen upon thy head, or ever
thou camest into the world&mdash;what evils in thy passage into
it!&mdash;what evils since!&mdash;produced into being, in the
decline of thy father's days&mdash;when the powers of his
imagination and of his body were waxing feeble&mdash;when radical
heat and radical moisture, the elements which should have temper'd
thine, were drying up; and nothing left to found thy stamina in,
but negations&mdash;'tis pitiful&mdash;brother Toby, at the best,
and called out for all the little helps that care and attention on
both sides could give it. But how were we defeated! You know the
event, brother Toby&mdash;'tis too melancholy a one to be repeated
now&mdash;when the few animal spirits I was worth in the world, and
with which memory, fancy, and quick parts should have been
convey'd&mdash;were all dispersed, confused, confounded, scattered,
and sent to the devil.&mdash;</p>
<p>Here then was the time to have put a stop to this persecution
against him;&mdash;and tried an experiment at least&mdash;whether
calmness and serenity of mind in your sister, with a due attention,
brother Toby, to her evacuations and repletions&mdash;and the rest
of her non-naturals, might not, in a course of nine months
gestation, have set all things to rights.&mdash;My child was bereft
of these!&mdash;What a teazing life did she lead herself, and
consequently her foetus too, with that nonsensical anxiety of hers
about lying-in in town? I thought my sister submitted with the
greatest patience, replied my uncle Toby&mdash;I never heard her
utter one fretful word about it.&mdash;She fumed inwardly, cried my
father; and that, let me tell you, brother, was ten times worse for
the child&mdash;and then! what battles did she fight with me, and
what perpetual storms about the midwife.&mdash;There she gave vent,
said my uncle Toby.&mdash;Vent! cried my father, looking up.</p>
<p>But what was all this, my dear Toby, to the injuries done us by
my child's coming head foremost into the world, when all I wished,
in this general wreck of his frame, was to have saved this little
casket unbroke, unrifled.&mdash;</p>
<p>With all my precautions, how was my system turned topside-turvy
in the womb with my child! his head exposed to the hand of
violence, and a pressure of 470 pounds avoirdupois weight acting so
perpendicularly upon its apex&mdash;that at this hour 'tis ninety
per Cent. insurance, that the fine net-work of the intellectual web
be not rent and torn to a thousand tatters.</p>
<p>&mdash;Still we could have done.&mdash;Fool, coxcomb,
puppy&mdash;give him but a Nose&mdash;Cripple, Dwarf, Driveller,
Goosecap&mdash;(shape him as you will) the door of fortune stands
open&mdash;O Licetus! Licetus! had I been blest with a foetus five
inches long and a half, like thee&mdash;Fate might have done her
worst.</p>
<p>Still, brother Toby, there was one cast of the dye left for our
child after all&mdash;O Tristram! Tristram! Tristram!</p>
<p>We will send for Mr. Yorick, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;You may send for whom you will, replied my father.</p>

<p>As Francis the first of France was one winterly night warming
himself over the embers of a wood fire, and talking with his first
minister of sundry things for the good of the state (Vide
Menagiana, Vol. I.)&mdash;It would not be amiss, said the king,
stirring up the embers with his cane, if this good understanding
betwixt ourselves and Switzerland was a little
strengthened.&mdash;There is no end, Sire, replied the minister, in
giving money to these people&mdash;they would swallow up the
treasury of France.&mdash;Poo! poo! answered the king&mdash;there
are more ways, Mons. le Premier, of bribing states, besides that of
giving money&mdash;I'll pay Switzerland the honour of standing
godfather for my next child.&mdash;Your majesty, said the minister,
in so doing, would have all the grammarians in Europe upon your
back;&mdash;Switzerland, as a republic, being a female, can in no
construction be godfather.&mdash;She may be godmother, replied
Francis hastily&mdash;so announce my intentions by a courier
to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>I am astonished, said Francis the First, (that day fortnight)
speaking to his minister as he entered the closet, that we have had
no answer from Switzerland.&mdash;Sire, I wait upon you this
moment, said Mons. le Premier, to lay before you my dispatches upon
that business.&mdash;They take it kindly, said the king.&mdash;They
do, Sire, replied the minister, and have the highest sense of the
honour your majesty has done them&mdash;but the republick, as
godmother, claims her right, in this case, of naming the child.</p>
<p>In all reason, quoth the king&mdash;she will christen him
Francis, or Henry, or Lewis, or some name that she knows will be
agreeable to us. Your majesty is deceived, replied the
minister&mdash;I have this hour received a dispatch from our
resident, with the determination of the republic on that point
also.&mdash;And what name has the republick fixed upon for the
Dauphin?&mdash;Shadrach, Mesech, Abed-nego, replied the
minister.&mdash;By Saint Peter's girdle, I will have nothing to do
with the Swiss, cried Francis the First, pulling up his breeches
and walking hastily across the floor.</p>
<p>Your majesty, replied the minister calmly, cannot bring yourself
off.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LVIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;But can the thing be undone, Yorick? said my
father&mdash;for in my opinion, continued he, it cannot. I am a
vile canonist, replied Yorick&mdash;but of all evils, holding
suspence to be the most tormenting, we shall at least know the
worst of this matter. I hate these great dinners&mdash;said my
father&mdash;The size of the dinner is not the point, answered
Yorick&mdash;we want, Mr. Shandy, to dive into the bottom of this
doubt, whether the name can be changed or not&mdash;and as the
beards of so many commissaries, officials, advocates, proctors,
registers, and of the most eminent of our school-divines, and
others, are all to meet in the middle of one table, and Didius has
so pressingly invited you&mdash;who in your distress would miss
such an occasion? All that is requisite, continued Yorick, is to
apprize Didius, and let him manage a conversation after dinner so
as to introduce the subject.&mdash;Then my brother Toby, cried my
father, clapping his two hands together, shall go with us.</p>
<p>&mdash;Let my old tye-wig, quoth my uncle Toby, and my laced
regimentals, be hung to the fire all night, Trim.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;No doubt, Sir,&mdash;there is a whole chapter wanting
here&mdash;and a chasm of ten pages made in the book by
it&mdash;but the book-binder is neither a fool, or a knave, or a
puppy&mdash;nor is the book a jot more imperfect (at least upon
that score)&mdash;but, on the contrary, the book is more perfect
and complete by wanting the chapter, than having it, as I shall
demonstrate to your reverences in this manner.&mdash;I question
first, by-the-bye, whether the same experiment might not be made as
successfully upon sundry other chapters&mdash;but there is no end,
an' please your reverences, in trying experiments upon
chapters&mdash;we have had enough of it&mdash;So there's an end of
that matter.</p>
<p>But before I begin my demonstration, let me only tell you, that
the chapter which I have torn out, and which otherwise you would
all have been reading just now, instead of this&mdash;was the
description of my father's, my uncle Toby's, Trim's, and Obadiah's
setting out and journeying to the visitation at....</p>
<p>We'll go in the coach, said my father&mdash;Prithee, have the
arms been altered, Obadiah?&mdash;It would have made my story much
better to have begun with telling you, that at the time my mother's
arms were added to the Shandy's, when the coach was re-painted upon
my father's marriage, it had so fallen out that the coach-painter,
whether by performing all his works with the left hand, like
Turpilius the Roman, or Hans Holbein of Basil&mdash;or whether
'twas more from the blunder of his head than hand&mdash;or whether,
lastly, it was from the sinister turn which every thing relating to
our family was apt to take&mdash;it so fell out, however, to our
reproach, that instead of the bend-dexter, which since Harry the
Eighth's reign was honestly our due&mdash;a bend-sinister, by some
of these fatalities, had been drawn quite across the field of the
Shandy arms. 'Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a man as
my father was, could be so much incommoded with so small a matter.
The word coach&mdash;let it be whose it would&mdash;or coach-man,
or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could never be named in the family,
but he constantly complained of carrying this vile mark of
illegitimacy upon the door of his own; he never once was able to
step into the coach, or out of it, without turning round to take a
view of the arms, and making a vow at the same time, that it was
the last time he would ever set his foot in it again, till the
bend-sinister was taken out&mdash;but like the affair of the hinge,
it was one of the many things which the Destinies had set down in
their books ever to be grumbled at (and in wiser families than
ours)&mdash;but never to be mended.</p>
<p>&mdash;Has the bend-sinister been brush'd out, I say? said my
father.&mdash;There has been nothing brush'd out, Sir, answered
Obadiah, but the lining. We'll go o'horseback, said my father,
turning to Yorick&mdash;Of all things in the world, except
politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry, said
Yorick.&mdash;No matter for that, cried my father&mdash;I should be
sorry to appear with a blot in my escutcheon before
them.&mdash;Never mind the bend-sinister, said my uncle Toby,
putting on his tye-wig.&mdash;No, indeed, said my father&mdash;you
may go with my aunt Dinah to a visitation with a bend-sinister, if
you think fit&mdash;My poor uncle Toby blush'd. My father was vexed
at himself.&mdash;No&mdash;my dear brother Toby, said my father,
changing his tone&mdash;but the damp of the coach-lining about my
loins, may give me the sciatica again, as it did December, January,
and February last winter&mdash;so if you please you shall ride my
wife's pad&mdash;and as you are to preach, Yorick, you had better
make the best of your way before&mdash;and leave me to take care of
my brother Toby, and to follow at our own rates.</p>
<p>Now the chapter I was obliged to tear out, was the description
of this cavalcade, in which Corporal Trim and Obadiah, upon two
coach-horses a-breast, led the way as slow as a
patrole&mdash;whilst my uncle Toby, in his laced regimentals and
tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep roads and
dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and arms,
as each could get the start.</p>
<p>&mdash;But the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it,
appears to be so much above the stile and manner of any thing else
I have been able to paint in this book, that it could not have
remained in it, without depreciating every other scene; and
destroying at the same time that necessary equipoise and balance,
(whether of good or bad) betwixt chapter and chapter, from whence
the just proportions and harmony of the whole work results. For my
own part, I am but just set up in the business, so know little
about it&mdash;but, in my opinion, to write a book is for all the
world like humming a song&mdash;be but in tune with yourself,
madam, 'tis no matter how high or how low you take it.</p>
<p>&mdash;This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that
some of the lowest and flattest compositions pass off very
well&mdash;(as Yorick told my uncle Toby one night) by
siege.&mdash;My uncle Toby looked brisk at the sound of the word
siege, but could make neither head or tail of it.</p>
<p>I'm to preach at court next Sunday, said Homenas&mdash;run over
my notes&mdash;so I humm'd over doctor Homenas's notes&mdash;the
modulation's very well&mdash;'twill do, Homenas, if it holds on at
this rate&mdash;so on I humm'd&mdash;and a tolerable tune I thought
it was; and to this hour, may it please your reverences, had never
found out how low, how flat, how spiritless and jejune it was, but
that all of a sudden, up started an air in the middle of it, so
fine, so rich, so heavenly,&mdash;it carried my soul up with it
into the other world; now had I (as Montaigne complained in a
parallel accident)&mdash;had I found the declivity easy, or the
ascent accessible&mdash;certes I had been outwitted.&mdash;Your
notes, Homenas, I should have said, are good notes;&mdash;but it
was so perpendicular a precipice&mdash;so wholly cut off from the
rest of the work, that by the first note I humm'd I found myself
flying into the other world, and from thence discovered the vale
from whence I came, so deep, so low, and dismal, that I shall never
have the heart to descend into it again.</p>
<p>A dwarf who brings a standard along with him to measure his own
size&mdash;take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than
one.&mdash;And so much for tearing out of chapters.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LXI.</h2>
<p>&mdash;See if he is not cutting it into slips, and giving them
about him to light their pipes!&mdash;'Tis abominable, answered
Didius; it should not go unnoticed, said doctor Kysarcius&mdash;he
was of the Kysarcii of the Low Countries.</p>
<p>Methinks, said Didius, half rising from his chair, in order to
remove a bottle and a tall decanter, which stood in a direct line
betwixt him and Yorick&mdash;you might have spared this sarcastic
stroke, and have hit upon a more proper place, Mr. Yorick&mdash;or
at least upon a more proper occasion to have shewn your contempt of
what we have been about: If the sermon is of no better worth than
to light pipes with&mdash;'twas certainly, Sir, not good enough to
be preached before so learned a body; and if 'twas good enough to
be preached before so learned a body&mdash;'twas certainly Sir, too
good to light their pipes with afterwards.</p>
<p>&mdash;I have got him fast hung up, quoth Didius to himself,
upon one of the two horns of my dilemma&mdash;let him get off as he
can.</p>
<p>I have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing forth
this sermon, quoth Yorick, upon this occasion&mdash;that I declare,
Didius, I would suffer martyrdom&mdash;and if it was possible my
horse with me, a thousand times over, before I would sit down and
make such another: I was delivered of it at the wrong end of
me&mdash;it came from my head instead of my heart&mdash;and it is
for the pain it gave me, both in the writing and preaching of it,
that I revenge myself of it, in this manner&mdash;To preach, to
shew the extent of our reading, or the subtleties of our
wit&mdash;to parade in the eyes of the vulgar with the beggarly
accounts of a little learning, tinsel'd over with a few words which
glitter, but convey little light and less warmth&mdash;is a
dishonest use of the poor single half hour in a week which is put
into our hands&mdash;'Tis not preaching the gospel&mdash;but
ourselves&mdash;For my own part, continued Yorick, I had rather
direct five words point-blank to the heart.&mdash;As Yorick
pronounced the word point-blank, my uncle Toby rose up to say
something upon projectiles&mdash;when a single word and no more
uttered from the opposite side of the table drew every one's ears
towards it&mdash;a word of all others in the dictionary the last in
that place to be expected&mdash;a word I am ashamed to
write&mdash;yet must be written&mdash;must be
read&mdash;illegal&mdash; uncanonical&mdash;guess ten thousand
guesses, multiplied into themselves&mdash; rack&mdash;torture your
invention for ever, you're where you was&mdash;In short, I'll tell
it in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LXII.</h2>
<p>Zounds!&mdash;Z...ds! cried Phutatorius, partly to
himself&mdash;and yet high enough to be heard&mdash;and what seemed
odd, 'twas uttered in a construction of look, and in a tone of
voice, somewhat between that of a man in amazement and one in
bodily pain.</p>
<p>One or two who had very nice ears, and could distinguish the
expression and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a third or a
fifth, or any other chord in musick&mdash;were the most puzzled and
perplexed with it&mdash;the concord was good in itself&mdash;but
then 'twas quite out of the key, and no way applicable to the
subject started;&mdash;so that with all their knowledge, they could
not tell what in the world to make of it.</p>
<p>Others who knew nothing of musical expression, and merely lent
their ears to the plain import of the word, imagined that
Phutatorius, who was somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was just going
to snatch the cudgels out of Didius's hands, in order to bemaul
Yorick to some purpose&mdash;and that the desperate monosyllable
Z...ds was the exordium to an oration, which, as they judged from
the sample, presaged but a rough kind of handling of him; so that
my uncle Toby's good-nature felt a pang for what Yorick was about
to undergo. But seeing Phutatorius stop short, without any attempt
or desire to go on&mdash;a third party began to suppose, that it
was no more than an involuntary respiration, casually forming
itself into the shape of a twelve-penny oath&mdash;without the sin
or substance of one.</p>
<p>Others, and especially one or two who sat next him, looked upon
it on the contrary as a real and substantial oath, propensly formed
against Yorick, to whom he was known to bear no good
liking&mdash;which said oath, as my father philosophized upon it,
actually lay fretting and fuming at that very time in the upper
regions of Phutatorius's purtenance; and so was naturally, and
according to the due course of things, first squeezed out by the
sudden influx of blood which was driven into the right ventricle of
Phutatorius's heart, by the stroke of surprize which so strange a
theory of preaching had excited.</p>
<p>How finely we argue upon mistaken facts!</p>
<p>There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon
the monosyllable which Phutatorius uttered&mdash;who did not take
this for granted, proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely, that
Phutatorius's mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was
arising between Didius and Yorick; and indeed as he looked first
towards the one and then towards the other, with the air of a man
listening to what was going forwards&mdash;who would not have
thought the same? But the truth was, that Phutatorius knew not one
word or one syllable of what was passing&mdash;but his whole
thoughts and attention were taken up with a transaction which was
going forwards at that very instant within the precincts of his own
Galligaskins, and in a part of them, where of all others he stood
most interested to watch accidents: So that notwithstanding he
looked with all the attention in the world, and had gradually
skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face, to the utmost pitch
the instrument would bear, in order, as it was thought, to give a
sharp reply to Yorick, who sat over-against him&mdash;yet, I say,
was Yorick never once in any one domicile of Phutatorius's
brain&mdash;but the true cause of his exclamation lay at least a
yard below.</p>
<p>This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable
decency.</p>
<p>You must be informed then, that Gastripheres, who had taken a
turn into the kitchen a little before dinner, to see how things
went on&mdash;observing a wicker-basket of fine chesnuts standing
upon the dresser, had ordered that a hundred or two of them might
be roasted and sent in, as soon as dinner was
over&mdash;Gastripheres inforcing his orders about them, that
Didius, but Phutatorius especially, were particularly fond of
'em.</p>
<p>About two minutes before the time that my uncle Toby interrupted
Yorick's harangue&mdash;Gastripheres's chesnuts were brought
in&mdash;and as Phutatorius's fondness for 'em was uppermost in the
waiter's head, he laid them directly before Phutatorius, wrapt up
hot in a clean damask napkin.</p>
<p>Now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen
hands all thrust into the napkin at a time&mdash;but that some one
chesnut, of more life and rotundity than the rest, must be put in
motion&mdash;it so fell out, however, that one was actually sent
rolling off the table; and as Phutatorius sat straddling
under&mdash;it fell perpendicularly into that particular aperture
of Phutatorius's breeches, for which, to the shame and indelicacy
of our language be it spoke, there is no chaste word throughout all
Johnson's dictionary&mdash;let it suffice to say&mdash;it was that
particular aperture which, in all good societies, the laws of
decorum do strictly require, like the temple of Janus (in peace at
least) to be universally shut up.</p>
<p>The neglect of this punctilio in Phutatorius (which by-the-bye
should be a warning to all mankind) had opened a door to this
accident.&mdash;</p>
<p>Accident I call it, in compliance to a received mode of
speaking&mdash;but in no opposition to the opinion either of
Acrites or Mythogeras in this matter; I know they were both
prepossessed and fully persuaded of it&mdash;and are so to this
hour, That there was nothing of accident in the whole
event&mdash;but that the chesnut's taking that particular course,
and in a manner of its own accord&mdash;and then falling with all
its heat directly into that one particular place, and no
other&mdash;was a real judgment upon Phutatorius for that filthy
and obscene treatise de Concubinis retinendis, which Phutatorius
had published about twenty years ago&mdash;and was that identical
week going to give the world a second edition of.</p>
<p>It is not my business to dip my pen in this
controversy&mdash;much undoubtedly may be wrote on both sides of
the question&mdash;all that concerns me as an historian, is to
represent the matter of fact, and render it credible to the reader,
that the hiatus in Phutatorius's breeches was sufficiently wide to
receive the chesnut;&mdash;and that the chesnut, somehow or other,
did fall perpendicularly, and piping hot into it, without
Phutatorius's perceiving it, or any one else at that time.</p>
<p>The genial warmth which the chesnut imparted, was not
undelectable for the first twenty or five-and-twenty
seconds&mdash;and did no more than gently solicit Phutatorius's
attention towards the part:&mdash;But the heat gradually
increasing, and in a few seconds more getting beyond the point of
all sober pleasure, and then advancing with all speed into the
regions of pain, the soul of Phutatorius, together with all his
ideas, his thoughts, his attention, his imagination, judgment,
resolution, deliberation, ratiocination, memory, fancy, with ten
battalions of animal spirits, all tumultuously crowded down,
through different defiles and circuits, to the place of danger,
leaving all his upper regions, as you may imagine, as empty as my
purse.</p>
<p>With the best intelligence which all these messengers could
bring him back, Phutatorius was not able to dive into the secret of
what was going forwards below, nor could he make any kind of
conjecture, what the devil was the matter with it: However, as he
knew not what the true cause might turn out, he deemed it most
prudent in the situation he was in at present, to bear it, if
possible, like a Stoick; which, with the help of some wry faces and
compursions of the mouth, he had certainly accomplished, had his
imagination continued neuter;&mdash;but the sallies of the
imagination are ungovernable in things of this kind&mdash;a thought
instantly darted into his mind, that tho' the anguish had the
sensation of glowing heat&mdash;it might, notwithstanding that, be
a bite as well as a burn; and if so, that possibly a Newt or an
Asker, or some such detested reptile, had crept up, and was
fastening his teeth&mdash;the horrid idea of which, with a fresh
glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut, seized
Phutatorius with a sudden panick, and in the first terrifying
disorder of the passion, it threw him, as it has done the best
generals upon earth, quite off his guard:&mdash;the effect of which
was this, that he leapt incontinently up, uttering as he rose that
interjection of surprise so much descanted upon, with the
aposiopestic break after it, marked thus, Z...ds&mdash;which,
though not strictly canonical, was still as little as any man could
have said upon the occasion;&mdash;and which, by-the-bye, whether
canonical or not, Phutatorius could no more help than he could the
cause of it.</p>
<p>Though this has taken up some time in the narrative, it took up
little more time in the transaction, than just to allow time for
Phutatorius to draw forth the chesnut, and throw it down with
violence upon the floor&mdash;and for Yorick to rise from his
chair, and pick the chesnut up.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over
the mind:&mdash;What incredible weight they have in forming and
governing our opinions, both of men and things&mdash;that trifles,
light as air, shall waft a belief into the soul, and plant it so
immoveably within it&mdash;that Euclid's demonstrations, could they
be brought to batter it in breach, should not all have power to
overthrow it.</p>
<p>Yorick, I said, picked up the chesnut which Phutatorius's wrath
had flung down&mdash;the action was trifling&mdash;I am ashamed to
account for it&mdash;he did it, for no reason, but that he thought
the chesnut not a jot worse for the adventure&mdash;and that he
held a good chesnut worth stooping for.&mdash;But this incident,
trifling as it was, wrought differently in Phutatorius's head: He
considered this act of Yorick's in getting off his chair and
picking up the chesnut, as a plain acknowledgment in him, that the
chesnut was originally his&mdash;and in course, that it must have
been the owner of the chesnut, and no one else, who could have
played him such a prank with it: What greatly confirmed him in this
opinion, was this, that the table being parallelogramical and very
narrow, it afforded a fair opportunity for Yorick, who sat directly
over against Phutatorius, of slipping the chesnut in&mdash;and
consequently that he did it. The look of something more than
suspicion, which Phutatorius cast full upon Yorick as these
thoughts arose, too evidently spoke his opinion&mdash;and as
Phutatorius was naturally supposed to know more of the matter than
any person besides, his opinion at once became the general
one;&mdash;and for a reason very different from any which have been
yet given&mdash;in a little time it was put out of all manner of
dispute.</p>
<p>When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this
sublunary world&mdash;the mind of man, which is an inquisitive kind
of a substance, naturally takes a flight behind the scenes to see
what is the cause and first spring of them.&mdash;The search was
not long in this instance.</p>
<p>It was well known that Yorick had never a good opinion of the
treatise which Phutatorius had wrote de Concubinis retinendis, as a
thing which he feared had done hurt in the world&mdash;and 'twas
easily found out, that there was a mystical meaning in Yorick's
prank&mdash;and that his chucking the chesnut hot into
Phutatorius's...&mdash;..., was a sarcastical fling at his
book&mdash;the doctrines of which, they said, had enflamed many an
honest man in the same place.</p>
<p>This conceit awaken'd Somnolentus&mdash;made Agelastes
smile&mdash;and if you can recollect the precise look and air of a
man's face intent in finding out a riddle&mdash;it threw
Gastripheres's into that form&mdash;and in short was thought by
many to be a master-stroke of arch-wit.</p>
<p>This, as the reader has seen from one end to the other, was as
groundless as the dreams of philosophy: Yorick, no doubt, as
Shakespeare said of his ancestor&mdash;'was a man of jest,' but it
was temper'd with something which withheld him from that, and many
other ungracious pranks, of which he as undeservedly bore the
blame;&mdash;but it was his misfortune all his life long to bear
the imputation of saying and doing a thousand things, of which
(unless my esteem blinds me) his nature was incapable. All I blame
him for&mdash;or rather, all I blame and alternately like him for,
was that singularity of his temper, which would never suffer him to
take pains to set a story right with the world, however in his
power. In every ill usage of that sort, he acted precisely as in
the affair of his lean horse&mdash;he could have explained it to
his honour, but his spirit was above it; and besides, he ever
looked upon the inventor, the propagator and believer of an
illiberal report alike so injurious to him&mdash;he could not stoop
to tell his story to them&mdash;and so trusted to time and truth to
do it for him.</p>
<p>This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many
respects&mdash;in the present it was followed by the fixed
resentment of Phutatorius, who, as Yorick had just made an end of
his chesnut, rose up from his chair a second time, to let him know
it&mdash;which indeed he did with a smile; saying only&mdash;that
he would endeavour not to forget the obligation.</p>
<p>But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these
two things in your mind.</p>
<p>&mdash;The smile was for the company.</p>
<p>&mdash;The threat was for Yorick.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LXIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;Can you tell me, quoth Phutatorius, speaking to
Gastripheres who sat next to him&mdash;for one would not apply to a
surgeon in so foolish an affair&mdash;can you tell me,
Gastripheres, what is best to take out the fire?&mdash;Ask
Eugenius, said Gastripheres.&mdash;That greatly depends, said
Eugenius, pretending ignorance of the adventure, upon the nature of
the part&mdash;If it is a tender part, and a part which can
conveniently be wrapt up&mdash;It is both the one and the other,
replied Phutatorius, laying his hand as he spoke, with an
emphatical nod of his head, upon the part in question, and lifting
up his right leg at the same time to ease and ventilate
it.&mdash;If that is the case, said Eugenius, I would advise you,
Phutatorius, not to tamper with it by any means; but if you will
send to the next printer, and trust your cure to such a simple
thing as a soft sheet of paper just come off the press&mdash;you
need do nothing more than twist it round.&mdash;The damp paper,
quoth Yorick (who sat next to his friend Eugenius) though I know it
has a refreshing coolness in it&mdash;yet I presume is no more than
the vehicle&mdash;and that the oil and lamp-black with which the
paper is so strongly impregnated, does the business.&mdash;Right,
said Eugenius, and is, of any outward application I would venture
to recommend, the most anodyne and safe.</p>
<p>Was it my case, said Gastripheres, as the main thing is the oil
and lamp-black, I should spread them thick upon a rag, and clap it
on directly.&mdash;That would make a very devil of it, replied
Yorick.&mdash;And besides, added Eugenius, it would not answer the
intention, which is the extreme neatness and elegance of the
prescription, which the Faculty hold to be half in half;&mdash;for
consider, if the type is a very small one (which it should be) the
sanative particles, which come into contact in this form, have the
advantage of being spread so infinitely thin, and with such a
mathematical equality (fresh paragraphs and large capitals
excepted) as no art or management of the spatula can come up
to.&mdash;It falls out very luckily, replied Phutatorius, that the
second edition of my treatise de Concubinis retinendis is at this
instant in the press.&mdash;You may take any leaf of it, said
Eugenius&mdash;no matter which.&mdash;Provided, quoth Yorick, there
is no bawdry in it.&mdash;</p>
<p>They are just now, replied Phutatorius, printing off the ninth
chapter&mdash;which is the last chapter but one in the
book.&mdash;Pray what is the title of that chapter? said Yorick;
making a respectful bow to Phutatorius as he spoke.&mdash;I think,

<h2>Chapter 2.LXIV.</h2>
<p>&mdash;Now, quoth Didius, rising up, and laying his right hand
with his fingers spread upon his breast&mdash;had such a blunder
about a christian-name happened before the Reformation&mdash;(It
happened the day before yesterday, quoth my uncle Toby to
himself)&mdash;and when baptism was administer'd in
Latin&mdash;('Twas all in English, said my uncle)&mdash;many things
might have coincided with it, and upon the authority of sundry
decreed cases, to have pronounced the baptism null, with a power of
giving the child a new name&mdash;Had a priest, for instance, which
was no uncommon thing, through ignorance of the Latin tongue,
baptized a child of Tom-o'Stiles, in nomine patriae &amp; filia
&amp; spiritum sanctos&mdash;the baptism was held null.&mdash;I beg
your pardon, replied Kysarcius&mdash;in that case, as the mistake
was only the terminations, the baptism was valid&mdash;and to have
rendered it null, the blunder of the priest should have fallen upon
the first syllable of each noun&mdash;and not, as in your case,
upon the last.</p>
<p>My father delighted in subtleties of this kind, and listen'd
with infinite attention.</p>
<p>Gastripheres, for example, continued Kysarcius, baptizes a child
of John Stradling's in Gomine gatris, &amp;c. &amp;c. instead of in
Nomine patris, &amp;c.&mdash;Is this a baptism? No&mdash;say the
ablest canonists; in as much as the radix of each word is hereby
torn up, and the sense and meaning of them removed and changed
quite to another object; for Gomine does not signify a name, nor
gatris a father.&mdash;What do they signify? said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;Nothing at all&mdash;quoth Yorick.&mdash;Ergo, such a
baptism is null, said Kysarcius.&mdash;</p>
<p>In course, answered Yorick, in a tone two parts jest and one
part earnest.&mdash;But in the case cited, continued Kysarcius,
where patriae is put for patris, filia for filii, and so
on&mdash;as it is a fault only in the declension, and the roots of
the words continue untouch'd, the inflections of their branches
either this way or that, does not in any sort hinder the baptism,
inasmuch as the same sense continues in the words as
before.&mdash;But then, said Didius, the intention of the priest's
pronouncing them grammatically must have been proved to have gone
along with it.&mdash;Right, answered Kysarcius; and of this,
brother Didius, we have an instance in a decree of the decretals of
Pope Leo the IIId.&mdash;But my brother's child, cried my uncle
Toby, has nothing to do with the Pope&mdash;'tis the plain child of
a Protestant gentleman, christen'd Tristram against the wills and
wishes both of his father and mother, and all who are a-kin to
it.&mdash;</p>
<p>If the wills and wishes, said Kysarcius, interrupting my uncle
Toby, of those only who stand related to Mr. Shandy's child, were
to have weight in this matter, Mrs. Shandy, of all people, has the
least to do in it.&mdash;My uncle Toby lay'd down his pipe, and my
father drew his chair still closer to the table, to hear the
conclusion of so strange an introduction.</p>
<p>&mdash;It has not only been a question, Captain Shandy, amongst
the (Vide Swinburn on Testaments, Part 7. para 8.) best lawyers and
civilians in this land, continued Kysarcius, 'Whether the mother be
of kin to her child,'&mdash;but, after much dispassionate enquiry
and jactitation of the arguments on all sides&mdash;it has been
adjudged for the negative&mdash;namely, 'That the mother is not of
kin to her child.' (Vide Brook Abridg. Tit. Administr. N. 47.) My
father instantly clapp'd his hand upon my uncle Toby's mouth, under
colour of whispering in his ear;&mdash;the truth was, he was
alarmed for Lillabullero&mdash;and having a great desire to hear
more of so curious an argument&mdash;he begg'd my uncle Toby, for
heaven's sake, not to disappoint him in it.&mdash;My uncle Toby
gave a nod&mdash;resumed his pipe, and contenting himself with
whistling Lillabullero inwardly&mdash;Kysarcius, Didius, and
Triptolemus went on with the discourse as follows:</p>
<p>This determination, continued Kysarcius, how contrary soever it
may seem to run to the stream of vulgar ideas, yet had reason
strongly on its side; and has been put out of all manner of dispute
from the famous case, known commonly by the name of the Duke of
Suffolk's case.&mdash;It is cited in Brook, said
Triptolemus&mdash;And taken notice of by Lord Coke, added
Didius.&mdash;And you may find it in Swinburn on Testaments, said
Kysarcius.</p>
<p>The case, Mr. Shandy, was this:</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward the Sixth, Charles duke of Suffolk having
issue a son by one venter, and a daughter by another venter, made
his last will, wherein he devised goods to his son, and died; after
whose death the son died also&mdash;but without will, without wife,
and without child&mdash;his mother and his sister by the father's
side (for she was born of the former venter) then living. The
mother took the administration of her son's goods, according to the
statute of the 21st of Harry the Eighth, whereby it is enacted,
That in case any person die intestate the administration of his
goods shall be committed to the next of kin.</p>
<p>The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the
mother, the sister by the father's side commenced a suit before the
Ecclesiastical Judge, alledging, 1st, That she herself was next of
kin; and 2dly, That the mother was not of kin at all to the party
deceased; and therefore prayed the court, that the administration
granted to the mother might be revoked, and be committed unto her,
as next of kin to the deceased, by force of the said statute.</p>
<p>Hereupon, as it was a great cause, and much depending upon its
issue&mdash;and many causes of great property likely to be decided
in times to come, by the precedent to be then made&mdash;the most
learned, as well in the laws of this realm, as in the civil law,
were consulted together, whether the mother was of kin to her son,
or no.&mdash;Whereunto not only the temporal lawyers&mdash;but the
church lawyers&mdash;the juris-consulti&mdash;the
jurisprudentes&mdash;the civilians&mdash;the advocates&mdash;the
commissaries&mdash;the judges of the consistory and prerogative
courts of Canterbury and York, with the master of the faculties,
were all unanimously of opinion, That the mother was not of (Mater
non numeratur inter consanguineos, Bald. in ult. C. de Verb.
signific.) kin to her child.&mdash;</p>
<p>And what said the duchess of Suffolk to it? said my uncle
Toby.</p>
<p>The unexpectedness of my uncle Toby's question, confounded
Kysarcius more than the ablest advocate&mdash;He stopp'd a full
minute, looking in my uncle Toby's face without replying&mdash;and
in that single minute Triptolemus put by him, and took the lead as
follows.</p>
<p>'Tis a ground and principle in the law, said Triptolemus, that
things do not ascend, but descend in it; and I make no doubt 'tis
for this cause, that however true it is, that the child may be of
the blood and seed of its parents&mdash;that the parents,
nevertheless, are not of the blood and seed of it; inasmuch as the
parents are not begot by the child, but the child by the
parents&mdash;For so they write, Liberi sunt de sanguine patris
&amp; matris, sed pater &amp; mater non sunt de sanguine
liberorum.</p>
<p>&mdash;But this, Triptolemus, cried Didius, proves too
much&mdash;for from this authority cited it would follow, not only
what indeed is granted on all sides, that the mother is not of kin
to her child&mdash;but the father likewise.&mdash;It is held, said
Triptolemus, the better opinion; because the father, the mother,
and the child, though they be three persons, yet are they but (una
caro (Vide Brook Abridg. tit. Administr. N.47.)) one flesh; and
consequently no degree of kindred&mdash;or any method of acquiring
one in nature.&mdash;There you push the argument again too far,
cried Didius&mdash;for there is no prohibition in nature, though
there is in the Levitical law&mdash;but that a man may beget a
child upon his grandmother&mdash;in which case, supposing the issue
a daughter, she would stand in relation both of&mdash;But who ever
thought, cried Kysarcius, of laying with his grandmother?&mdash;The
young gentleman, replied Yorick, whom Selden speaks of&mdash;who
not only thought of it, but justified his intention to his father
by the argument drawn from the law of retaliation.&mdash;'You laid,
Sir, with my mother,' said the lad&mdash;'why may not I lay with
yours?'&mdash;'Tis the Argumentum commune, added Yorick.&mdash;'Tis
as good, replied Eugenius, taking down his hat, as they
deserve.</p>
<p>The company broke up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LXV.</h2>
<p>&mdash;And pray, said my uncle Toby, leaning upon Yorick, as he
and my father were helping him leisurely down the
stairs&mdash;don't be terrified, madam, this stair-case
conversation is not so long as the last&mdash;And pray, Yorick,
said my uncle Toby, which way is this said affair of Tristram at
length settled by these learned men? Very satisfactorily, replied
Yorick; no mortal, Sir, has any concern with it&mdash;for Mrs.
Shandy the mother is nothing at all a-kin to him&mdash;and as the
mother's is the surest side&mdash;Mr. Shandy, in course is still
less than nothing&mdash;In short, he is not as much a-kin to him,
Sir, as I am.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;That may well be, said my father, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&mdash;Let the learned say what they will, there must certainly,
quoth my uncle Toby, have been some sort of consanguinity betwixt
the duchess of Suffolk and her son.</p>
<p>The vulgar are of the same opinion, quoth Yorick, to this
hour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LXVI.</h2>
<p>Though my father was hugely tickled with the subtleties of these
learned discourses&mdash;'twas still but like the anointing of a
broken bone&mdash;The moment he got home, the weight of his
afflictions returned upon him but so much the heavier, as is ever
the case when the staff we lean on slips from under us.&mdash;He
became pensive&mdash;walked frequently forth to the
fish-pond&mdash;let down one loop of his hat&mdash;sigh'd
often&mdash;forbore to snap&mdash;and, as the hasty sparks of
temper, which occasion snapping, so much assist perspiration and
digestion, as Hippocrates tells us&mdash;he had certainly fallen
ill with the extinction of them, had not his thoughts been
critically drawn off, and his health rescued by a fresh train of
disquietudes left him, with a legacy of a thousand pounds, by my
aunt Dinah.</p>
<p>My father had scarce read the letter, when taking the thing by
the right end, he instantly began to plague and puzzle his head how
to lay it out mostly to the honour of his family.&mdash;A
hundred-and-fifty odd projects took possession of his brains by
turns&mdash;he would do this, and that and t'other&mdash;He would
go to Rome&mdash;he would go to law&mdash;he would buy
stock&mdash;he would buy John Hobson's farm&mdash;he would new fore
front his house, and add a new wing to make it even&mdash;There was
a fine water-mill on this side, and he would build a wind-mill on
the other side of the river in full view to answer it&mdash;But
above all things in the world, he would inclose the great Ox-moor,
and send out my brother Bobby immediately upon his travels.</p>
<p>But as the sum was finite, and consequently could not do every
thing&mdash;and in truth very few of these to any purpose&mdash;of
all the projects which offered themselves upon this occasion, the
two last seemed to make the deepest impression; and he would
infallibly have determined upon both at once, but for the small
inconvenience hinted at above, which absolutely put him under a
necessity of deciding in favour either of the one or the other.</p>
<p>This was not altogether so easy to be done; for though 'tis
certain my father had long before set his heart upon this necessary
part of my brother's education, and like a prudent man had actually
determined to carry it into execution, with the first money that
returned from the second creation of actions in the
Missisippi-scheme, in which he was an adventurer&mdash;yet the
Ox-moor, which was a fine, large, whinny, undrained, unimproved
common, belonging to the Shandy-estate, had almost as old a claim
upon him: he had long and affectionately set his heart upon turning
it likewise to some account.</p>
<p>But having never hitherto been pressed with such a conjuncture
of things, as made it necessary to settle either the priority or
justice of their claims&mdash;like a wise man he had refrained
entering into any nice or critical examination about them: so that
upon the dismission of every other project at this crisis&mdash;the
two old projects, the Ox-moor and my Brother, divided him again;
and so equal a match were they for each other, as to become the
occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman's
mind&mdash;which of the two should be set o'going first.</p>
<p>&mdash;People may laugh as they will&mdash;but the case was
this.</p>
<p>It had ever been the custom of the family, and by length of time
was almost become a matter of common right, that the eldest son of
it should have free ingress, egress, and regress into foreign parts
before marriage&mdash;not only for the sake of bettering his own
private parts, by the benefit of exercise and change of so much
air&mdash;but simply for the mere delectation of his fancy, by the
feather put into his cap, of having been abroad&mdash;tantum valet,
my father would say, quantum sonat.</p>
<p>Now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian
indulgence&mdash;to deprive him of it, without why or
wherefore&mdash;and thereby make an example of him, as the first
Shandy unwhirl'd about Europe in a post-chaise, and only because he
was a heavy lad&mdash;would be using him ten times worse than a
Turk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the case of the Ox-moor was full as hard.</p>
<p>Exclusive of the original purchase-money, which was eight
hundred pounds&mdash;it had cost the family eight hundred pounds
more in a law-suit about fifteen years before&mdash;besides the
Lord knows what trouble and vexation.</p>
<p>It had been moreover in possession of the Shandy-family ever
since the middle of the last century; and though it lay full in
view before the house, bounded on one extremity by the water-mill,
and on the other by the projected wind-mill spoken of
above&mdash;and for all these reasons seemed to have the fairest
title of any part of the estate to the care and protection of the
family&mdash;yet by an unaccountable fatality, common to men, as
well as the ground they tread on&mdash;it had all along most
shamefully been overlook'd; and to speak the truth of it, had
suffered so much by it, that it would have made any man's heart
have bled (Obadiah said) who understood the value of the land, to
have rode over it, and only seen the condition it was in.</p>
<p>However, as neither the purchasing this tract of
ground&mdash;nor indeed the placing of it where it lay, were either
of them, properly speaking, of my father's doing&mdash;he had never
thought himself any way concerned in the affair&mdash;till the
fifteen years before, when the breaking out of that cursed law-suit
mentioned above (and which had arose about its
boundaries)&mdash;which being altogether my father's own act and
deed, it naturally awakened every other argument in its favour, and
upon summing them all up together, he saw, not merely in interest,
but in honour, he was bound to do something for it&mdash;and that
now or never was the time.</p>
<p>I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in
it, that the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally
balanced by each other; for though my father weigh'd them in all
humours and conditions&mdash;spent many an anxious hour in the most
profound and abstracted meditation upon what was best to be
done&mdash;reading books of farming one day&mdash;books of travels
another&mdash;laying aside all passion whatever&mdash;viewing the
arguments on both sides in all their lights and
circumstances&mdash;communing every day with my uncle
Toby&mdash;arguing with Yorick, and talking over the whole affair
of the Ox-moor with Obadiah&mdash;yet nothing in all that time
appeared so strongly in behalf of the one, which was not either
strictly applicable to the other, or at least so far
counterbalanced by some consideration of equal weight, as to keep
the scales even.</p>
<p>For to be sure, with proper helps, in the hands of some people,
tho' the Ox-moor would undoubtedly have made a different appearance
in the world from what it did, or ever could do in the condition it
lay&mdash;yet every tittle of this was true, with regard to my
brother Bobby&mdash;let Obadiah say what he would.&mdash;</p>
<p>In point of interest&mdash;the contest, I own, at first sight,
did not appear so undecisive betwixt them; for whenever my father
took pen and ink in hand, and set about calculating the simple
expence of paring and burning, and fencing in the Ox-moor, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;with the certain profit it would bring him in
return&mdash;the latter turned out so prodigiously in his way of
working the account, that you would have sworn the Ox-moor would
have carried all before it. For it was plain he should reap a
hundred lasts of rape, at twenty pounds a last, the very first
year&mdash;besides an excellent crop of wheat the year
following&mdash;and the year after that, to speak within bounds, a
hundred&mdash;but in all likelihood, a hundred and fifty&mdash;if
not two hundred quarters of pease and beans&mdash;besides potatoes
without end.&mdash;But then, to think he was all this while
breeding up my brother, like a hog to eat them&mdash;knocked all on
the head again, and generally left the old gentleman in such a
state of suspense&mdash;that, as he often declared to my uncle
Toby&mdash;he knew no more than his heels what to do.</p>
<p>No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing
thing it is to have a man's mind torn asunder by two projects of
equal strength, both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at
the same time: for to say nothing of the havock, which by a certain
consequence is unavoidably made by it all over the finer system of
the nerves, which you know convey the animal spirits and more
subtle juices from the heart to the head, and so on&mdash;it is not
to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction works
upon the more gross and solid parts, wasting the fat and impairing
the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and
forwards.</p>
<p>My father had certainly sunk under this evil, as certainly as he
had done under that of my Christian Name&mdash;had he not been
rescued out of it, as he was out of that, by a fresh evil&mdash;the
misfortune of my brother Bobby's death.</p>
<p>What is the life of man! Is it not to shift from side to
side?&mdash;from sorrow to sorrow?&mdash;to button up one cause of
vexation&mdash;and unbutton another?</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.LXVII.</h2>
<p>From this moment I am to be considered as heir-apparent to the
Shandy family&mdash;and it is from this point properly, that the
story of my Life and my Opinions sets out. With all my hurry and
precipitation, I have but been clearing the ground to raise the
building&mdash;and such a building do I foresee it will turn out,
as never was planned, and as never was executed since Adam. In less
than five minutes I shall have thrown my pen into the fire, and the
little drop of thick ink which is left remaining at the bottom of
my ink-horn, after it&mdash;I have but half a score things to do in
the time&mdash;I have a thing to name&mdash;a thing to
lament&mdash;a thing to hope&mdash;a thing to promise, and a thing
to threaten&mdash;I have a thing to suppose&mdash;a thing to
declare&mdash;a thing to conceal&mdash;a thing to choose, and a
thing to pray for&mdash;This chapter, therefore, I name the chapter
of Things&mdash;and my next chapter to it, that is, the first
chapter of my next volume, if I live, shall be my chapter upon
Whiskers, in order to keep up some sort of connection in my
works.</p>
<p>The thing I lament is, that things have crowded in so thick upon
me, that I have not been able to get into that part of my work,
towards which I have all the way looked forwards, with so much
earnest desire; and that is the Campaigns, but especially the
amours of my uncle Toby, the events of which are of so singular a
nature, and so Cervantick a cast, that if I can so manage it, as to
convey but the same impressions to every other brain, which the
occurrences themselves excite in my own&mdash;I will answer for it
the book shall make its way in the world, much better than its
master has done before it.&mdash;Oh Tristram! Tristram! can this
but be once brought about&mdash;the credit, which will attend thee
as an author, shall counterbalance the many evils will have
befallen thee as a man&mdash;thou wilt feast upon the
one&mdash;when thou hast lost all sense and remembrance of the
other&mdash;!</p>
<p>No wonder I itch so much as I do, to get at these
amours&mdash;They are the choicest morsel of my whole story! and
when I do get at 'em&mdash;assure yourselves, good folks&mdash;(nor
do I value whose squeamish stomach takes offence at it) I shall not
be at all nice in the choice of my words!&mdash;and that's the
thing I have to declare.&mdash;I shall never get all through in
five minutes, that I fear&mdash;and the thing I hope is, that your
worships and reverences are not offended&mdash;if you are, depend
upon't I'll give you something, my good gentry, next year to be
offended at&mdash;that's my dear Jenny's way&mdash;but who my Jenny
is&mdash;and which is the right and which the wrong end of a woman,
is the thing to be concealed&mdash;it shall be told you in the next
chapter but one to my chapter of Button-holes&mdash;and not one
chapter before.</p>
<p>And now that you have just got to the end of these (According to
the preceding Editions.) three volumes&mdash;the thing I have to
ask is, how you feel your heads? my own akes dismally!&mdash;as for
your healths, I know, they are much better.&mdash;True Shandeism,
think what you will against it, opens the heart and lungs, and like
all those affections which partake of its nature, it forces the
blood and other vital fluids of the body to run freely through its
channels, makes the wheel of life run long and cheerfully
round.</p>
<p>Was I left, like Sancho Panca, to choose my kingdom, it should
not be maritime&mdash;or a kingdom of blacks to make a penny
of;&mdash;no, it should be a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects:
And as the bilious and more saturnine passions, by creating
disorders in the blood and humours, have as bad an influence, I
see, upon the body politick as body natural&mdash;and as nothing
but a habit of virtue can fully govern those passions, and subject
them to reason&mdash;I should add to my prayer&mdash;that God would
give my subjects grace to be as Wise as they were Merry; and then
should I be the happiest monarch, and they are the happiest people
under heaven.</p>
<p>And so with this moral for the present, may it please your
worships and your reverences, I take my leave of you till this time
twelve-month, when, (unless this vile cough kills me in the mean
time) I'll have another pluck at your beards, and lay open a story
to the world you little dream of.</p>

<p>If it had not been for those two mettlesome tits, and that
madcap of a postillion who drove them from Stilton to Stamford, the
thought had never entered my head. He flew like
lightning&mdash;there was a slope of three miles and a

well as working-days, to be shewing the relicks of learning, as
monks do the relicks of their saints&mdash;without working
one&mdash;one single miracle with them?</p>
<p>Who made Man, with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in
a moment&mdash;that great, that most excellent, and most noble
creature of the world&mdash;the miracle of nature, as Zoroaster in
his book (Greek) called him&mdash;the Shekinah of the divine
presence, as Chrysostom&mdash;the image of God, as Moses&mdash;the
ray of divinity, as Plato&mdash;the marvel of marvels, as
Aristotle&mdash;to go sneaking on at this
pitiful&mdash;pimping&mdash;pettifogging rate?</p>
<p>I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the occasion&mdash;but
if there is no catachresis in the wish, and no sin in it, I wish
from my soul, that every imitator in Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, had the farcy for his pains; and that there was a good
farcical house, large enough to hold&mdash;aye&mdash;and sublimate
them, shag rag and bob-tail, male and female, all together: and
this leads me to the affair of Whiskers&mdash;but, by what chain of
ideas&mdash;I leave as a legacy in mort-main to Prudes and Tartufs,
to enjoy and make the most of.</p>
<p>Upon Whiskers.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I made it&mdash;'twas as inconsiderate a promise as
ever entered a man's head&mdash;A chapter upon whiskers! alas! the
world will not bear it&mdash;'tis a delicate world&mdash;but I knew
not of what mettle it was made&mdash;nor had I ever seen the
under-written fragment; otherwise, as surely as noses are noses,
and whiskers are whiskers still (let the world say what it will to
the contrary); so surely would I have steered clear of this
dangerous chapter.</p>
<p>The Fragment.</p>
<p>...&mdash;You are half asleep, my good lady, said the old
gentleman, taking hold of the old lady's hand, and giving it a
gentle squeeze, as he pronounced the word Whiskers&mdash;shall we
change the subject? By no means, replied the old lady&mdash;I like
your account of those matters; so throwing a thin gauze
handkerchief over her head, and leaning it back upon the chair with
her face turned towards him, and advancing her two feet as she
reclined herself&mdash;I desire, continued she, you will go on.</p>
<p>The old gentleman went on as follows:&mdash;Whiskers! cried the
queen of Navarre, dropping her knotting ball, as La Fosseuse
uttered the word&mdash;Whiskers, madam, said La Fosseuse, pinning
the ball to the queen's apron, and making a courtesy as she
repeated it.</p>
<p>La Fosseuse's voice was naturally soft and low, yet 'twas an
articulate voice: and every letter of the word Whiskers fell
distinctly upon the queen of Navarre's ear&mdash;Whiskers! cried
the queen, laying a greater stress upon the word, and as if she had
still distrusted her ears&mdash;Whiskers! replied La Fosseuse,
repeating the word a third time&mdash;There is not a cavalier,
madam, of his age in Navarre, continued the maid of honour,
pressing the page's interest upon the queen, that has so gallant a
pair&mdash;Of what? cried Margaret, smiling&mdash;Of whiskers, said
La Fosseuse, with infinite modesty.</p>
<p>The word Whiskers still stood its ground, and continued to be
made use of in most of the best companies throughout the little
kingdom of Navarre, notwithstanding the indiscreet use which La
Fosseuse had made of it: the truth was, La Fosseuse had pronounced
the word, not only before the queen, but upon sundry other
occasions at court, with an accent which always implied something
of a mystery&mdash;And as the court of Margaret, as all the world
knows, was at that time a mixture of gallantry and
devotion&mdash;and whiskers being as applicable to the one, as the
other, the word naturally stood its ground&mdash;it gained full as
much as it lost; that is, the clergy were for it&mdash;the laity
were against it&mdash;and for the women,&mdash;they were
divided.</p>
<p>The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur De
Croix, was at that time beginning to draw the attention of the
maids of honour towards the terrace before the palace gate, where
the guard was mounted. The lady De Baussiere fell deeply in love
with him,&mdash;La Battarelle did the same&mdash;it was the finest
weather for it, that ever was remembered in Navarre&mdash;La Guyol,
La Maronette, La Sabatiere, fell in love with the Sieur De Croix
also&mdash;La Rebours and La Fosseuse knew better&mdash;De Croix
had failed in an attempt to recommend himself to La Rebours; and La
Rebours and La Fosseuse were inseparable.</p>
<p>The queen of Navarre was sitting with her ladies in the painted
bow-window, facing the gate of the second court, as De Croix passed
through it&mdash;He is handsome, said the Lady Baussiere&mdash;He
has a good mien, said La Battarelle&mdash;He is finely shaped, said
La Guyol&mdash;I never saw an officer of the horse-guards in my
life, said La Maronette, with two such legs&mdash;Or who stood so
well upon them, said La Sabatiere&mdash;But he has no whiskers,
cried La Fosseuse&mdash;Not a pile, said La Rebours.</p>
<p>The queen went directly to her oratory, musing all the way, as
she walked through the gallery, upon the subject; turning it this
way and that way in her fancy&mdash;Ave Maria!&mdash;what can
La-Fosseuse mean? said she, kneeling down upon the cushion.</p>
<p>La Guyol, La Battarelle, La Maronette, La Sabatiere, retired
instantly to their chambers&mdash;Whiskers! said all four of them
to themselves, as they bolted their doors on the inside.</p>
<p>The Lady Carnavallette was counting her beads with both hands,
unsuspected, under her farthingal&mdash;from St. Antony down to St.
Ursula inclusive, not a saint passed through her fingers without
whiskers; St. Francis, St. Dominick, St. Bennet, St. Basil, St.
Bridget, had all whiskers.</p>
<p>The Lady Baussiere had got into a wilderness of conceits, with
moralizing too intricately upon La Fosseuse's text&mdash;She
mounted her palfrey, her page followed her&mdash;the host passed
by&mdash;the Lady Baussiere rode on.</p>
<p>One denier, cried the order of mercy&mdash;one single denier, in
behalf of a thousand patient captives, whose eyes look towards
heaven and you for their redemption.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Lady Baussiere rode on.</p>
<p>Pity the unhappy, said a devout, venerable, hoary-headed man,
meekly holding up a box, begirt with iron, in his withered
hands&mdash;I beg for the unfortunate&mdash;good my Lady, 'tis for
a prison&mdash;for an hospital&mdash;'tis for an old man&mdash;a
poor man undone by shipwreck, by suretyship, by fire&mdash;I call
God and all his angels to witness&mdash;'tis to clothe the
naked&mdash;to feed the hungry&mdash;'tis to comfort the sick and
the broken-hearted.</p>
<p>The Lady Baussiere rode on.</p>
<p>A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Lady Baussiere rode on.</p>
<p>He ran begging bare-headed on one side of her palfrey, conjuring
her by the former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity,
&amp;c.&mdash;Cousin, aunt, sister, mother,&mdash;for virtue's
sake, for your own, for mine, for Christ's sake, remember
me&mdash;pity me.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Lady Baussiere rode on.</p>
<p>Take hold of my whiskers, said the Lady Baussiere&mdash;The page
took hold of her palfrey. She dismounted at the end of the
terrace.</p>
<p>There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of
themselves about our eyes and eye-brows; and there is a
consciousness of it, somewhere about the heart, which serves but to
make these etchings the stronger&mdash;we see, spell, and put them
together without a dictionary.</p>
<p>Ha, ha! he, hee! cried La Guyol and La Sabatiere, looking close
at each other's prints&mdash;Ho, ho! cried La Battarelle and
Maronette, doing the same:&mdash;Whist! cried one&mdash;ft,
ft,&mdash;said a second&mdash;hush, quoth a third&mdash;poo, poo,
replied a fourth&mdash;gramercy! cried the Lady
Carnavallette;&mdash;'twas she who bewhisker'd St. Bridget.</p>
<p>La Fosseuse drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair, and
having traced the outline of a small whisker, with the blunt end of
it, upon one side of her upper lip, put in into La Rebours'
hand&mdash;La Rebours shook her head.</p>
<p>The Lady Baussiere coughed thrice into the inside of her
muff&mdash;La Guyol smiled&mdash;Fy, said the Lady Baussiere. The
queen of Navarre touched her eye with the tip of her
fore-finger&mdash;as much as to say, I understand you all.</p>
<p>'Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined: La Fosseuse
had given it a wound, and it was not the better for passing through
all these defiles&mdash;It made a faint stand, however, for a few
months, by the expiration of which, the Sieur De Croix, finding it
high time to leave Navarre for want of whiskers&mdash;the word in
course became indecent, and (after a few efforts) absolutely unfit
for use.</p>
<p>The best word, in the best language of the best world, must have
suffered under such combinations.&mdash;The curate of d'Estella
wrote a book against them, setting forth the dangers of accessory
ideas, and warning the Navarois against them.</p>
<p>Does not all the world know, said the curate d'Estella at the
conclusion of his work, that Noses ran the same fate some centuries
ago in most parts of Europe, which Whiskers have now done in the
kingdom of Navarre?&mdash;The evil indeed spread no farther
then&mdash;but have not beds and bolsters, and night-caps and
chamber-pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since? Are
not trouse, and placket-holes, and pump-handles&mdash;and spigots
and faucets, in danger still from the same
association?&mdash;Chastity, by nature, the gentlest of all
affections&mdash;give it but its head&mdash;'tis like a ramping and
a roaring lion.</p>
<p>The drift of the curate d'Estella's argument was not
understood.&mdash;They ran the scent the wrong way.&mdash;The world
bridled his ass at the tail.&mdash;And when the extremes of
Delicacy, and the beginnings of Concupiscence, hold their next
provincial chapter together, they may decree that bawdy also.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.II.</h2>
<p>When my father received the letter which brought him the
melancholy account of my brother Bobby's death, he was busy
calculating the expence of his riding post from Calais to Paris,
and so on to Lyons.</p>
<p>'Twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had every
foot of it to travel over again, and his calculation to begin
afresh, when he had almost got to the end of it, by Obadiah's
opening the door to acquaint him the family was out of
yeast&mdash;and to ask whether he might not take the great
coach-horse early in the morning and ride in search of
some.&mdash;With all my heart, Obadiah, said my father (pursuing
his journey)&mdash;take the coach-horse, and welcome.&mdash;But he
wants a shoe, poor creature! said Obadiah.&mdash;Poor creature!
said my uncle Toby, vibrating the note back again, like a string in
unison. Then ride the Scotch horse, quoth my father
hastily.&mdash;He cannot bear a saddle upon his back, quoth
Obadiah, for the whole world.&mdash;The devil's in that horse; then
take Patriot, cried my father, and shut the door.&mdash;Patriot is
sold, said Obadiah. Here's for you! cried my father, making a
pause, and looking in my uncle Toby's face, as if the thing had not
been a matter of fact.&mdash;Your worship ordered me to sell him
last April, said Obadiah.&mdash;Then go on foot for your pains,
cried my father&mdash;I had much rather walk than ride, said
Obadiah, shutting the door.</p>
<p>What plagues, cried my father, going on with his
calculation.&mdash;But the waters are out, said
Obadiah,&mdash;opening the door again.</p>
<p>Till that moment, my father, who had a map of Sanson's, and a
book of the post-roads before him, had kept his hand upon the head
of his compasses, with one foot of them fixed upon Nevers, the last
stage he had paid for&mdash;purposing to go on from that point with
his journey and calculation, as soon as Obadiah quitted the room:
but this second attack of Obadiah's, in opening the door and laying
the whole country under water, was too much.&mdash;He let go his
compasses&mdash;or rather with a mixed motion between accident and
anger, he threw them upon the table; and then there was nothing for
him to do, but to return back to Calais (like many others) as wise
as he had set out.</p>
<p>When the letter was brought into the parlour, which contained
the news of my brother's death, my father had got forwards again
upon his journey to within a stride of the compasses of the very
same stage of Nevers.&mdash;By your leave, Mons. Sanson, cried my
father, striking the point of his compasses through Nevers into the
table&mdash;and nodding to my uncle Toby to see what was in the
letter&mdash;twice of one night, is too much for an English
gentleman and his son, Mons. Sanson, to be turned back from so
lousy a town as Nevers&mdash;What think'st thou, Toby? added my
father in a sprightly tone.&mdash;Unless it be a garrison town,
said my uncle Toby&mdash;for then&mdash;I shall be a fool, said my
father, smiling to himself, as long as I live.&mdash;So giving a
second nod&mdash;and keeping his compasses still upon Nevers with
one hand, and holding his book of the post-roads in the
other&mdash;half calculating and half listening, he leaned forwards
upon the table with both elbows, as my uncle Toby hummed over the
letter.</p>
<p>...he's gone! said my uncle Toby&mdash;Where&mdash;Who? cried my
father.&mdash;My nephew, said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;What&mdash;without leave&mdash;without
money&mdash;without governor? cried my father in amazement.
No:&mdash;he is dead, my dear brother, quoth my uncle
Toby.&mdash;Without being ill? cried my father again.&mdash;I dare
say not, said my uncle Toby, in a low voice, and fetching a deep
sigh from the bottom of his heart, he has been ill enough, poor
lad! I'll answer for him&mdash;for he is dead.</p>
<p>When Agrippina was told of her son's death, Tacitus informs us,
that, not being able to moderate the violence of her passions, she
abruptly broke off her work&mdash;My father stuck his compasses
into Nevers, but so much the faster.&mdash;What contrarieties! his,
indeed, was matter of calculation!&mdash;Agrippina's must have been
quite a different affair; who else could pretend to reason from
history?</p>
<p>How my father went on, in my opinion, deserves a chapter to
itself.&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.III.</h2>
<p>...&mdash;And a chapter it shall have, and a devil of a one
too&mdash;so look to yourselves.</p>
<p>'Tis either Plato, or Plutarch, or Seneca, or Xenophon, or
Epictetus, or Theophrastus, or Lucian&mdash;or some one perhaps of
later date&mdash;either Cardan, or Budaeus, or Petrarch, or
Stella&mdash;or possibly it may be some divine or father of the
church, St. Austin, or St. Cyprian, or Barnard, who affirms that it
is an irresistible and natural passion to weep for the loss of our
friends or children&mdash;and Seneca (I'm positive) tells us
somewhere, that such griefs evacuate themselves best by that
particular channel&mdash;And accordingly we find, that David wept
for his son Absalom&mdash;Adrian for his Antinous&mdash;Niobe for
her children, and that Apollodorus and Crito both shed tears for
Socrates before his death.</p>
<p>My father managed his affliction otherwise; and indeed
differently from most men either ancient or modern; for he neither
wept it away, as the Hebrews and the Romans&mdash;or slept it off,
as the Laplanders&mdash;or hanged it, as the English, or drowned
it, as the Germans,&mdash;nor did he curse it, or damn it, or
excommunicate it, or rhyme it, or lillabullero it.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;He got rid of it, however.</p>
<p>Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between
these two pages?</p>
<p>When Tully was bereft of his dear daughter Tullia, at first he
laid it to his heart,&mdash;he listened to the voice of nature, and
modulated his own unto it.&mdash;O my Tullia! my daughter! my
child!&mdash;still, still, still,&mdash;'twas O my Tullia!&mdash;my
Tullia! Methinks I see my Tullia, I hear my Tullia, I talk with my
Tullia.&mdash;But as soon as he began to look into the stores of
philosophy, and consider how many excellent things might be said
upon the occasion&mdash;no body upon earth can conceive, says the
great orator, how happy, how joyful it made me.</p>
<p>My father was as proud of his eloquence as Marcus Tullius Cicero
could be for his life, and, for aught I am convinced of to the
contrary at present, with as much reason: it was indeed his
strength&mdash;and his weakness too.&mdash;His strength&mdash;for
he was by nature eloquent; and his weakness&mdash;for he was hourly
a dupe to it; and, provided an occasion in life would but permit
him to shew his talents, or say either a wise thing, a witty, or a
shrewd one&mdash;(bating the case of a systematic
misfortune)&mdash;he had all he wanted.&mdash;A blessing which tied
up my father's tongue, and a misfortune which let it loose with a
good grace, were pretty equal: sometimes, indeed, the misfortune
was the better of the two; for instance, where the pleasure of the
harangue was as ten, and the pain of the misfortune but as
five&mdash;my father gained half in half, and consequently was as
well again off, as if it had never befallen him.</p>
<p>This clue will unravel what otherwise would seem very
inconsistent in my father's domestic character; and it is this,
that, in the provocations arising from the neglects and blunders of
servants, or other mishaps unavoidable in a family, his anger, or
rather the duration of it, eternally ran counter to all
conjecture.</p>
<p>My father had a favourite little mare, which he had consigned
over to a most beautiful Arabian horse, in order to have a pad out
of her for his own riding: he was sanguine in all his projects; so
talked about his pad every day with as absolute a security, as if
it had been reared, broke,&mdash;and bridled and saddled at his
door ready for mounting. By some neglect or other in Obadiah, it so
fell out, that my father's expectations were answered with nothing
better than a mule, and as ugly a beast of the kind as ever was
produced.</p>
<p>My mother and my uncle Toby expected my father would be the
death of Obadiah&mdash;and that there never would be an end of the
disaster&mdash;See here! you rascal, cried my father, pointing to
the mule, what you have done!&mdash;It was not me, said
Obadiah.&mdash;How do I know that? replied my father.</p>
<p>Triumph swam in my father's eyes, at the repartee&mdash;the
Attic salt brought water into them&mdash;and so Obadiah heard no
more about it.</p>
<p>Now let us go back to my brother's death.</p>
<p>Philosophy has a fine saying for every thing.&mdash;For Death it
has an entire set; the misery was, they all at once rushed into my
father's head, that 'twas difficult to string them together, so as
to make any thing of a consistent show out of them.&mdash;He took
them as they came.</p>
<p>''Tis an inevitable chance&mdash;the first statute in Magna
Charta&mdash;it is an everlasting act of parliament, my dear
brother,&mdash;All must die.</p>
<p>'If my son could not have died, it had been matter of
wonder,&mdash;not that he is dead.</p>
<p>'Monarchs and princes dance in the same ring with us.</p>
<p>'&mdash;To die, is the great debt and tribute due unto nature:
tombs and monuments, which should perpetuate our memories, pay it
themselves; and the proudest pyramid of them all, which wealth and
science have erected, has lost its apex, and stands obtruncated in
the traveller's horizon.' (My father found he got great ease, and
went on)&mdash;'Kingdoms and provinces, and towns and cities, have
they not their periods? and when those principles and powers, which
at first cemented and put them together, have performed their
several evolutions, they fall back.'&mdash;Brother Shandy, said my
uncle Toby, laying down his pipe at the word
evolutions&mdash;Revolutions, I meant, quoth my father,&mdash;by
heaven! I meant revolutions, brother Toby&mdash;evolutions is
nonsense.&mdash;'Tis not nonsense&mdash;said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;But is it not nonsense to break the thread of such a
discourse upon such an occasion? cried my father&mdash;do
not&mdash;dear Toby, continued he, taking him by the hand, do
not&mdash;do not, I beseech thee, interrupt me at this
crisis.&mdash;My uncle Toby put his pipe into his mouth.</p>
<p>'Where is Troy and Mycenae, and Thebes and Delos, and Persepolis
and Agrigentum?'&mdash;continued my father, taking up his book of
post-roads, which he had laid down.&mdash;'What is become, brother
Toby, of Nineveh and Babylon, of Cizicum and Mitylenae? The fairest
towns that ever the sun rose upon, are now no more; the names only
are left, and those (for many of them are wrong spelt) are falling
themselves by piece-meals to decay, and in length of time will be
forgotten, and involved with every thing in a perpetual night: the
world itself, brother Toby, must&mdash;must come to an end.</p>
<p>'Returning out of Asia, when I sailed from Aegina towards
Megara,' (when can this have been? thought my uncle Toby,) 'I began
to view the country round about. Aegina was behind me, Megara was
before, Pyraeus on the right hand, Corinth on the left.&mdash;What
flourishing towns now prostrate upon the earth! Alas! alas! said I
to myself, that man should disturb his soul for the loss of a
child, when so much as this lies awfully buried in his
presence&mdash;Remember, said I to myself again&mdash;remember thou
art a man.'&mdash;</p>
<p>Now my uncle Toby knew not that this last paragraph was an
extract of Servius Sulpicius's consolatory letter to
Tully.&mdash;He had as little skill, honest man, in the fragments,
as he had in the whole pieces of antiquity.&mdash;And as my father,
whilst he was concerned in the Turkey trade, had been three or four
different times in the Levant, in one of which he had stayed a
whole year and an half at Zant, my uncle Toby naturally concluded,
that, in some one of these periods, he had taken a trip across the
Archipelago into Asia; and that all this sailing affair with Aegina
behind, and Megara before, and Pyraeus on the right hand, &amp;c.
&amp;c. was nothing more than the true course of my father's voyage
and reflections.&mdash;'Twas certainly in his manner, and many an
undertaking critic would have built two stories higher upon worse
foundations.&mdash;And pray, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, laying
the end of his pipe upon my father's hand in a kindly way of
interruption&mdash;but waiting till he finished the
account&mdash;what year of our Lord was this?&mdash;'Twas no year
of our Lord, replied my father.&mdash;That's impossible, cried my
uncle Toby.&mdash;Simpleton! said my father,&mdash;'twas forty
years before Christ was born.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby had but two things for it; either to suppose his
brother to be the wandering Jew, or that his misfortunes had
disordered his brain.&mdash;'May the Lord God of heaven and earth
protect him and restore him!' said my uncle Toby, praying silently
for my father, and with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&mdash;My father placed the tears to a proper account, and went
on with his harangue with great spirit.</p>
<p>'There is not such great odds, brother Toby, betwixt good and
evil, as the world imagines'&mdash;(this way of setting off, by the
bye, was not likely to cure my uncle Toby's
suspicions).&mdash;'Labour, sorrow, grief, sickness, want, and woe,
are the sauces of life.'&mdash;Much good may do them&mdash;said my
uncle Toby to himself.&mdash;</p>
<p>'My son is dead!&mdash;so much the better;&mdash;'tis a shame in
such a tempest to have but one anchor.</p>
<p>'But he is gone for ever from us!&mdash;be it so. He is got from
under the hands of his barber before he was bald&mdash;he is but
risen from a feast before he was surfeited&mdash;from a banquet
before he had got drunken.</p>
<p>'The Thracians wept when a child was born,'&mdash;(and we were
very near it, quoth my uncle Toby,)&mdash;'and feasted and made
merry when a man went out of the world; and with
reason.&mdash;Death opens the gate of fame, and shuts the gate of
envy after it,&mdash;it unlooses the chain of the captive, and puts
the bondsman's task into another man's hands.</p>
<p>'Shew me the man, who knows what life is, who dreads it, and
I'll shew thee a prisoner who dreads his liberty.'</p>
<p>Is it not better, my dear brother Toby, (for mark&mdash;our
appetites are but diseases,)&mdash;is it not better not to hunger
at all, than to eat?&mdash;not to thirst, than to take physic to
cure it?</p>
<p>Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues, from love and
melancholy, and the other hot and cold fits of life, than, like a
galled traveller, who comes weary to his inn, to be bound to begin
his journey afresh?</p>
<p>There is no terrour, brother Toby, in its looks, but what it
borrows from groans and convulsions&mdash;and the blowing of noses
and the wiping away of tears with the bottoms of curtains, in a
dying man's room.&mdash;Strip it of these, what is it?&mdash;'Tis
better in battle than in bed, said my uncle Toby.&mdash;Take away
its hearses, its mutes, and its mourning,&mdash;its plumes,
scutcheons, and other mechanic aids&mdash;What is it?&mdash;Better
in battle! continued my father, smiling, for he had absolutely
forgot my brother Bobby&mdash;'tis terrible no way&mdash;for
consider, brother Toby,&mdash;when we are&mdash;death is
not;&mdash;and when death is&mdash;we are not. My uncle Toby laid
down his pipe to consider the proposition; my father's eloquence
was too rapid to stay for any man&mdash;away it went,&mdash;and
hurried my uncle Toby's ideas along with it.&mdash;</p>
<p>For this reason, continued my father, 'tis worthy to recollect,
how little alteration, in great men, the approaches of death have
made.&mdash;Vespasian died in a jest upon his
close-stool&mdash;Galba with a sentence&mdash;Septimus Severus in a
dispatch&mdash;Tiberius in dissimulation, and Caesar Augustus in a
compliment.&mdash;I hope 'twas a sincere one&mdash;quoth my uncle
Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Twas to his wife,&mdash;said my father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.IV.</h2>
<p>&mdash;And lastly&mdash;for all the choice anecdotes which
history can produce of this matter, continued my

fabric&mdash;crowns all.&mdash;</p>
<p>'Tis of Cornelius Gallus, the praetor&mdash;which, I dare say,
brother Toby, you have read.&mdash;I dare say I have not, replied
my uncle.&mdash;He died, said my father as...&mdash;And if it was
with his wife, said my uncle Toby&mdash;there could be no hurt in
it.&mdash;That's more than I know&mdash;replied my father.</p>

<p>My mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage
which led to the parlour, as my uncle Toby pronounced the word
wife.&mdash;'Tis a shrill penetrating sound of itself, and Obadiah
had helped it by leaving the door a little a-jar, so that my mother
heard enough of it to imagine herself the subject of the
conversation; so laying the edge of her finger across her two
lips&mdash;holding in her breath, and bending her head a little
downwards, with a twist of her neck&mdash;(not towards the door,
but from it, by which means her ear was brought to the
chink)&mdash;she listened with all her powers:&mdash;the listening
slave, with the Goddess of Silence at his back, could not have
given a finer thought for an intaglio.</p>
<p>In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five
minutes: till I bring up the affairs of the kitchen (as Rapin does
those of the church) to the same period.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.VI.</h2>
<p>Though in one sense, our family was certainly a simple machine,
as it consisted of a few wheels; yet there was thus much to be said
for it, that these wheels were set in motion by so many different
springs, and acted one upon the other from such a variety of
strange principles and impulses&mdash;that though it was a simple
machine, it had all the honour and advantages of a complex
one,&mdash;and a number of as odd movements within it, as ever were
beheld in the inside of a Dutch silk-mill.</p>
<p>Amongst these there was one, I am going to speak of, in which,
perhaps, it was not altogether so singular, as in many others; and
it was this, that whatever motion, debate, harangue, dialogue,
project, or dissertation, was going forwards in the parlour, there
was generally another at the same time, and upon the same subject,
running parallel along with it in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Now to bring this about, whenever an extraordinary message, or
letter, was delivered in the parlour&mdash;or a discourse suspended
till a servant went out&mdash;or the lines of discontent were
observed to hang upon the brows of my father or mother&mdash;or, in
short, when any thing was supposed to be upon the tapis worth
knowing or listening to, 'twas the rule to leave the door, not
absolutely shut, but somewhat a-jar&mdash;as it stands just
now,&mdash;which, under covert of the bad hinge, (and that possibly
might be one of the many reasons why it was never mended,) it was
not difficult to manage; by which means, in all these cases, a
passage was generally left, not indeed as wide as the Dardanelles,
but wide enough, for all that, to carry on as much of this windward
trade, as was sufficient to save my father the trouble of governing
his house;&mdash;my mother at this moment stands profiting by
it.&mdash;Obadiah did the same thing, as soon as he had left the
letter upon the table which brought the news of my brother's death,
so that before my father had well got over his surprise, and
entered upon his harangue,&mdash;had Trim got upon his legs, to
speak his sentiments upon the subject.</p>
<p>A curious observer of nature, had he been worth the inventory of
all Job's stock&mdash;though by the bye, your curious observers are
seldom worth a groat&mdash;would have given the half of it, to have
heard Corporal Trim and my father, two orators so contrasted by
nature and education, haranguing over the same bier.</p>
<p>My father&mdash;a man of deep reading&mdash;prompt
memory&mdash;with Cato, and Seneca, and Epictetus, at his fingers
ends.&mdash;</p>
<p>The corporal&mdash;with nothing&mdash;to remember&mdash;of no
deeper reading than his muster-roll&mdash;or greater names at his
fingers end, than the contents of it.</p>
<p>The one proceeding from period to period, by metaphor and
allusion, and striking the fancy as he went along (as men of wit
and fancy do) with the entertainment and pleasantry of his pictures
and images.</p>
<p>The other, without wit or antithesis, or point, or turn, this
way or that; but leaving the images on one side, and the picture on
the other, going straight forwards as nature could lead him, to the
heart. O Trim! would to heaven thou had'st a better
historian!&mdash;would!&mdash;thy historian had a better pair of
breeches!&mdash;O ye critics! will nothing melt you?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.VII.</h2>
<h3>&mdash;My young master in London is dead? said
Obadiah.&mdash;</h3>
<p>&mdash;A green sattin night-gown of my mother's, which had been
twice scoured, was the first idea which Obadiah's exclamation
brought into Susannah's head.&mdash;Well might Locke write a
chapter upon the imperfections of words.&mdash;Then, quoth
Susannah, we must all go into mourning.&mdash;But note a second
time: the word mourning, notwithstanding Susannah made use of it
herself&mdash;failed also of doing its office; it excited not one
single idea, tinged either with grey or black,&mdash;all was
green.&mdash;The green sattin night-gown hung there still.</p>
<p>&mdash;O! 'twill be the death of my poor mistress, cried
Susannah.&mdash;My mother's whole wardrobe followed.&mdash;What a
procession! her red damask,&mdash;her orange tawney,&mdash;her
white and yellow lutestrings,&mdash;her brown taffata,&mdash;her
bone-laced caps, her bed-gowns, and comfortable
under-petticoats.&mdash;Not a rag was left
behind.&mdash;'No,&mdash;she will never look up again,' said
Susannah.</p>
<p>We had a fat, foolish scullion&mdash;my father, I think, kept
her for her simplicity;&mdash;she had been all autumn struggling
with a dropsy.&mdash;He is dead, said Obadiah,&mdash;he is
certainly dead!&mdash;So am not I, said the foolish scullion.</p>
<p>&mdash;Here is sad news, Trim, cried Susannah, wiping her eyes
as Trim stepp'd into the kitchen,&mdash;master Bobby is dead and
buried&mdash;the funeral was an interpolation of
Susannah's&mdash;we shall have all to go into mourning, said
Susannah.</p>
<p>I hope not, said Trim.&mdash;You hope not! cried Susannah
earnestly.&mdash;The mourning ran not in Trim's head, whatever it
did in Susannah's.&mdash;I hope&mdash;said Trim, explaining
himself, I hope in God the news is not true. I heard the letter
read with my own ears, answered Obadiah; and we shall have a
terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the ox-moor.&mdash;Oh!
he's dead, said Susannah.&mdash;As sure, said the scullion, as I'm
alive.</p>
<p>I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said Trim, fetching
a sigh.&mdash;Poor creature!&mdash;poor boy!&mdash;poor
gentleman!</p>
<p>&mdash;He was alive last Whitsontide! said the
coachman.&mdash;Whitsontide! alas! cried Trim, extending his right
arm, and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he read
the sermon,&mdash;what is Whitsontide, Jonathan (for that was the
coachman's name), or Shrovetide, or any tide or time past, to this?
Are we not here now, continued the corporal (striking the end of
his stick perpendicularly upon the floor, so as to give an idea of
health and stability)&mdash;and are we not&mdash;(dropping his hat
upon the ground) gone! in a moment!&mdash;'Twas infinitely
striking! Susannah burst into a flood of tears.&mdash;We are not
stocks and stones.&mdash;Jonathan, Obadiah, the cook-maid, all
melted.&mdash;The foolish fat scullion herself, who was scouring a
fish-kettle upon her knees, was rous'd with it.&mdash;The whole
kitchen crowded about the corporal.</p>
<p>Now, as I perceive plainly, that the preservation of our
constitution in church and state,&mdash;and possibly the
preservation of the whole world&mdash;or what is the same thing,
the distribution and balance of its property and power, may in time
to come depend greatly upon the right understanding of this stroke
of the corporal's eloquence&mdash;I do demand your
attention&mdash;your worships and reverences, for any ten pages
together, take them where you will in any other part of the work,
shall sleep for it at your ease.</p>
<p>I said, 'we were not stocks and stones'&mdash;'tis very well. I
should have added, nor are we angels, I wish we were,&mdash;but men
clothed with bodies, and governed by our imaginations;&mdash;and
what a junketing piece of work of it there is, betwixt these and
our seven senses, especially some of them, for my own part, I own
it, I am ashamed to confess. Let it suffice to affirm, that of all
the senses, the eye (for I absolutely deny the touch, though most
of your Barbati, I know, are for it) has the quickest commerce with
the soul,&mdash;gives a smarter stroke, and leaves something more
inexpressible upon the fancy, than words can either convey&mdash;or
sometimes get rid of.</p>
<p>&mdash;I've gone a little about&mdash;no matter, 'tis for
health&mdash;let us only carry it back in our mind to the mortality
of Trim's hat&mdash;'Are we not here now,&mdash;and gone in a
moment?'&mdash;There was nothing in the sentence&mdash;'twas one of
your self-evident truths we have the advantage of hearing every
day; and if Trim had not trusted more to his hat than his
head&mdash;he made nothing at all of it.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Are we not here now;' continued the corporal, 'and are
we not'&mdash;(dropping his hat plumb upon the ground&mdash;and
pausing, before he pronounced the word)&mdash;'gone! in a moment?'
The descent of the hat was as if a heavy lump of clay had been
kneaded into the crown of it.&mdash;Nothing could have expressed
the sentiment of mortality, of which it was the type and
fore-runner, like it,&mdash;his hand seemed to vanish from under
it,&mdash;it fell dead,&mdash;the corporal's eye fixed upon it, as
upon a corpse,&mdash;and Susannah burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>Now&mdash;Ten thousand, and ten thousand times ten thousand (for
matter and motion are infinite) are the ways by which a hat may be
dropped upon the ground, without any effect.&mdash;Had he flung it,
or thrown it, or cast it, or skimmed it, or squirted it, or let it
slip or fall in any possible direction under heaven,&mdash;or in
the best direction that could be given to it,&mdash;had he dropped
it like a goose&mdash;like a puppy&mdash;like an ass&mdash;or in
doing it, or even after he had done, had he looked like a
fool&mdash;like a ninny&mdash;like a nincompoop&mdash;it had
fail'd, and the effect upon the heart had been lost.</p>
<p>Ye who govern this mighty world and its mighty concerns with the
engines of eloquence,&mdash;who heat it, and cool it, and melt it,
and mollify it,&mdash;and then harden it again to your
purpose&mdash;</p>
<p>Ye who wind and turn the passions with this great windlass, and,
having done it, lead the owners of them, whither ye think meet.</p>
<p>Ye, lastly, who drive&mdash;and why not, Ye also who are driven,
like turkeys to market with a stick and a red
clout&mdash;meditate&mdash;meditate, I beseech you, upon Trim's
hat.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.VIII.</h2>
<p>Stay&mdash;I have a small account to settle with the reader
before Trim can go on with his harangue.&mdash;It shall be done in
two minutes.</p>
<p>Amongst many other book-debts, all of which I shall discharge in
due time,&mdash;I own myself a debtor to the world for two
items,&mdash;a chapter upon chamber-maids and button-holes, which,
in the former part of my work, I promised and fully intended to pay
off this year: but some of your worships and reverences telling me,
that the two subjects, especially so connected together, might
endanger the morals of the world,&mdash;I pray the chapter upon
chamber-maids and button-holes may be forgiven me,&mdash;and that
they will accept of the last chapter in lieu of it; which is
nothing, an't please your reverences, but a chapter of
chamber-maids, green gowns, and old hats.</p>
<p>Trim took his hat off the ground,&mdash;put it upon his
head,&mdash;and then went on with his oration upon death, in manner
and form following.</p>

<p>&mdash;To us, Jonathan, who know not what want or care
is&mdash;who live here in the service of two of the best of
masters&mdash;(bating in my own case his majesty King William the
Third, whom I had the honour to serve both in Ireland and
Flanders)&mdash;I own it, that from Whitsontide to within three
weeks of Christmas,&mdash;'tis not long&mdash;'tis like
nothing;&mdash;but to those, Jonathan, who know what death is, and
what havock and destruction he can make, before a man can well
wheel about&mdash;'tis like a whole age.&mdash;O Jonathan! 'twould
make a good-natured man's heart bleed, to consider, continued the
corporal (standing perpendicularly), how low many a brave and
upright fellow has been laid since that time!&mdash;And trust me,
Susy, added the corporal, turning to Susannah, whose eyes were
swimming in water,&mdash;before that time comes round
again,&mdash;many a bright eye will be dim.&mdash;Susannah placed
it to the right side of the page&mdash;she wept&mdash;but she
court'sied too.&mdash;Are we not, continued Trim, looking still at
Susannah&mdash;are we not like a flower of the field&mdash;a tear
of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliation&mdash;else
no tongue could have described Susannah's affliction&mdash;is not
all flesh grass?&mdash;Tis clay,&mdash;'tis dirt.&mdash;They all
looked directly at the scullion,&mdash;the scullion had just been
scouring a fish-kettle.&mdash;It was not fair.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;What is the finest face that ever man looked at!&mdash;I
could hear Trim talk so for ever, cried Susannah,&mdash;what is it!
(Susannah laid her hand upon Trim's shoulder)&mdash;but
corruption?&mdash;Susannah took it off.</p>
<p>Now I love you for this&mdash;and 'tis this delicious mixture
within you which makes you dear creatures what you are&mdash;and he
who hates you for it&mdash;all I can say of the matter
is&mdash;That he has either a pumpkin for his head&mdash;or a
pippin for his heart,&mdash;and whenever he is dissected 'twill be
found so.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.X.</h2>
<p>Whether Susannah, by taking her hand too suddenly from off the
corporal's shoulder (by the whisking about of her
passions)&mdash;broke a little the chain of his
reflexions&mdash;</p>
<p>Or whether the corporal began to be suspicious, he had got into
the doctor's quarters, and was talking more like the chaplain than
himself&mdash;</p>
<p>Or whether...Or whether&mdash;for in all such cases a man of
invention and parts may with pleasure fill a couple of pages with
suppositions&mdash;which of all these was the cause, let the
curious physiologist, or the curious any body determine&mdash;'tis
certain, at least, the corporal went on thus with his harangue.</p>
<p>For my own part, I declare it, that out of doors, I value not
death at all:&mdash;not this...added the corporal, snapping his
fingers,&mdash;but with an air which no one but the corporal could
have given to the sentiment.&mdash;In battle, I value death not
this...and let him not take me cowardly, like poor Joe Gibbins, in
scouring his gun.&mdash;What is he? A pull of a trigger&mdash;a
push of a bayonet an inch this way or that&mdash;makes the
difference.&mdash;Look along the line&mdash;to the right&mdash;see!
Jack's down! well,&mdash;'tis worth a regiment of horse to
him.&mdash;No&mdash;'tis Dick. Then Jack's no worse.&mdash;Never
mind which,&mdash;we pass on,&mdash;in hot pursuit the wound itself
which brings him is not felt,&mdash;the best way is to stand up to
him,&mdash;the man who flies, is in ten times more danger than the
man who marches up into his jaws.&mdash;I've look'd him, added the
corporal, an hundred times in the face,&mdash;and know what he
is.&mdash;He's nothing, Obadiah, at all in the field.&mdash;But
he's very frightful in a house, quoth Obadiah.&mdash;I never mind
it myself, said Jonathan, upon a coach-box.&mdash;It must, in my
opinion, be most natural in bed, replied Susannah.&mdash;And could
I escape him by creeping into the worst calf's skin that ever was
made into a knapsack, I would do it there&mdash;said Trim&mdash;but
that is nature.</p>
<p>&mdash;Nature is nature, said Jonathan.&mdash;And that is the
reason, cried Susannah, I so much pity my mistress.&mdash;She will
never get the better of it.&mdash;Now I pity the captain the most
of any one in the family, answered Trim.&mdash;Madam will get ease
of heart in weeping,&mdash;and the Squire in talking about
it,&mdash;but my poor master will keep it all in silence to
himself.&mdash;I shall hear him sigh in his bed for a whole month
together, as he did for lieutenant Le Fever. An' please your
honour, do not sigh so piteously, I would say to him as I laid
besides him. I cannot help it, Trim, my master would
say,&mdash;'tis so melancholy an accident&mdash;I cannot get it off
my heart.&mdash;Your honour fears not death yourself.&mdash;I hope,
Trim, I fear nothing, he would say, but the doing a wrong
thing.&mdash;Well, he would add, whatever betides, I will take care
of Le Fever's boy.&mdash;And with that, like a quieting draught,
his honour would fall asleep.</p>
<p>I like to hear Trim's stories about the captain, said
Susannah.&mdash;He is a kindly-hearted gentleman, said Obadiah, as
ever lived.&mdash;Aye, and as brave a one too, said the corporal,
as ever stept before a platoon.&mdash;There never was a better
officer in the king's army,&mdash;or a better man in God's world;
for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon, though he saw the
lighted match at the very touch-hole,&mdash;and yet, for all that,
he has a heart as soft as a child for other people.&mdash;He would
not hurt a chicken.&mdash;I would sooner, quoth Jonathan, drive
such a gentleman for seven pounds a year&mdash;than some for
eight.&mdash;Thank thee, Jonathan! for thy twenty
shillings,&mdash;as much, Jonathan, said the corporal, shaking him
by the hand, as if thou hadst put the money into my own
pocket.&mdash;I would serve him to the day of my death out of love.
He is a friend and a brother to me,&mdash;and could I be sure my
poor brother Tom was dead,&mdash;continued the corporal, taking out
his handkerchief,&mdash;was I worth ten thousand pounds, I would
leave every shilling of it to the captain.&mdash;Trim could not
refrain from tears at this testamentary proof he gave of his
affection to his master.&mdash;The whole kitchen was
affected.&mdash;Do tell us the story of the poor lieutenant, said
Susannah.&mdash;With all my heart, answered the corporal.</p>
<p>Susannah, the cook, Jonathan, Obadiah, and corporal Trim, formed
a circle about the fire; and as soon as the scullion had shut the
kitchen door,&mdash;the corporal begun.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XII.</h2>
<h3>&mdash;But to return to my mother.</h3>
<p>My uncle Toby's opinion, Madam, 'that there could be no harm in
Cornelius Gallus, the Roman praetor's lying with his
wife;'&mdash;or rather the last word of that opinion,&mdash;(for it
was all my mother heard of it) caught hold of her by the weak part
of the whole sex:&mdash;You shall not mistake me,&mdash;I mean her
curiosity,&mdash;she instantly concluded herself the subject of the
conversation, and with that prepossession upon her fancy, you will
readily conceive every word my father said, was accommodated either
to herself, or her family concerns.</p>
<p>&mdash;Pray, Madam, in what street does the lady live, who would
not have done the same?</p>
<p>From the strange mode of Cornelius's death, my father had made a
transition to that of Socrates, and was giving my uncle Toby an
abstract of his pleading before his judges;&mdash;'twas
irresistible:&mdash;not the oration of Socrates,&mdash;but my
father's temptation to it.&mdash;He had wrote the Life of Socrates
(This book my father would never consent to publish; 'tis in
manuscript, with some other tracts of his, in the family, all, or
most of which will be printed in due time.) himself the year before
he left off trade, which, I fear, was the means of hastening him
out of it;&mdash;so that no one was able to set out with so full a
sail, and in so swelling a tide of heroic loftiness upon the
occasion, as my father was. Not a period in Socrates's oration,
which closed with a shorter word than transmigration, or
annihilation,&mdash;or a worse thought in the middle of it than to
be&mdash;or not to be,&mdash;the entering upon a new and untried
state of things,&mdash;or, upon a long, a profound and peaceful
sleep, without dreams, without disturbance?&mdash;That we and our
children were born to die,&mdash;but neither of us born to be
slaves.&mdash;No&mdash;there I mistake; that was part of Eleazer's
oration, as recorded by Josephus (de Bell. Judaic)&mdash;Eleazer
owns he had it from the philosophers of India; in all likelihood
Alexander the Great, in his irruption into India, after he had
over-run Persia, amongst the many things he stole,&mdash;stole that
sentiment also; by which means it was carried, if not all the way
by himself (for we all know he died at Babylon), at least by some
of his maroders, into Greece,&mdash;from Greece it got to
Rome,&mdash;from Rome to France,&mdash;and from France to
England:&mdash;So things come round.&mdash;</p>
<p>By land carriage, I can conceive no other way.&mdash;</p>
<p>By water the sentiment might easily have come down the Ganges
into the Sinus Gangeticus, or Bay of Bengal, and so into the Indian
Sea; and following the course of trade (the way from India by the
Cape of Good Hope being then unknown), might be carried with other
drugs and spices up the Red Sea to Joddah, the port of Mekka, or
else to Tor or Sues, towns at the bottom of the gulf; and from
thence by karrawans to Coptos, but three days journey distant, so
down the Nile directly to Alexandria, where the Sentiment would be
landed at the very foot of the great stair-case of the Alexandrian
library,&mdash;and from that store-house it would be
fetched.&mdash;Bless me! what a trade was driven by the learned in
those days!</p>

<p>&mdash;Now my father had a way, a little like that of Job's (in
case there ever was such a man&mdash;if not, there's an end of the
matter.&mdash;</p>
<p>Though, by the bye, because your learned men find some
difficulty in fixing the precise aera in which so great a man
lived;&mdash;whether, for instance, before or after the patriarchs,
&amp;c.&mdash;to vote, therefore, that he never lived at all, is a
little cruel,&mdash;'tis not doing as they would be done
by,&mdash;happen that as it may)&mdash;My father, I say, had a way,
when things went extremely wrong with him, especially upon the
first sally of his impatience,&mdash;of wondering why he was
begot,&mdash;wishing himself dead;&mdash;sometimes worse:&mdash;And
when the provocation ran high, and grief touched his lips with more
than ordinary powers&mdash;Sir, you scarce could have distinguished
him from Socrates himself.&mdash;Every word would breathe the
sentiments of a soul disdaining life, and careless about all its
issues; for which reason, though my mother was a woman of no deep
reading, yet the abstract of Socrates's oration, which my father
was giving my uncle Toby, was not altogether new to her.&mdash;She
listened to it with composed intelligence, and would have done so
to the end of the chapter, had not my father plunged (which he had
no occasion to have done) into that part of the pleading where the
great philosopher reckons up his connections, his alliances, and
children; but renounces a security to be so won by working upon the
passions of his judges.&mdash;'I have friends&mdash;I have
relations,&mdash;I have three desolate children,'&mdash;says
Socrates.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Then, cried my mother, opening the door,&mdash;you have
one more, Mr. Shandy, than I know of.</p>
<p>By heaven! I have one less,&mdash;said my father, getting up and
walking out of the room.</p>

<p>&mdash;They are Socrates's children, said my uncle Toby. He has
been dead a hundred years ago, replied my mother.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby was no chronologer&mdash;so not caring to advance
one step but upon safe ground, he laid down his pipe deliberately
upon the table, and rising up, and taking my mother most kindly by
the hand, without saying another word, either good or bad, to her,
he led her out after my father, that he might finish the
ecclaircissement himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XVI.</h2>
<p>The first thing which entered my father's head, after affairs
were a little settled in the family, and Susanna had got possession
of my mother's green sattin night-gown,&mdash;was to sit down
coolly, after the example of Xenophon, and write a Tristra-paedia,
or system of education for me; collecting first for that purpose
his own scattered thoughts, counsels, and notions; and binding them
together, so as to form an Institute for the government of my
childhood and adolescence. I was my father's last stake&mdash;he
had lost my brother Bobby entirely,&mdash;he had lost, by his own
computation, full three-fourths of me&mdash;that is, he had been
unfortunate in his three first great casts for me&mdash;my
geniture, nose, and name,&mdash;there was but this one left; and
accordingly my father gave himself up to it with as much devotion
as ever my uncle Toby had done to his doctrine of
projectils.&mdash;The difference between them was, that my uncle
Toby drew his whole knowledge of projectils from Nicholas
Tartaglia&mdash;My father spun his, every thread of it, out of his
own brain,&mdash;or reeled and cross-twisted what all other
spinners and spinsters had spun before him, that 'twas pretty near
the same torture to him.</p>
<p>In about three years, or something more, my father had got
advanced almost into the middle of his work.&mdash;Like all other
writers, he met with disappointments.&mdash;He imagined he should
be able to bring whatever he had to say, into so small a compass,
that when it was finished and bound, it might be rolled up in my
mother's hussive.&mdash;Matter grows under our hands.&mdash;Let no
man say,&mdash;'Come&mdash;I'll write a duodecimo.'</p>
<p>My father gave himself up to it, however, with the most painful
diligence, proceeding step by step in every line, with the same
kind of caution and circumspection (though I cannot say upon quite
so religious a principle) as was used by John de la Casse, the lord
archbishop of Benevento, in compassing his Galatea; in which his
Grace of Benevento spent near forty years of his life; and when the
thing came out, it was not of above half the size or the thickness
of a Rider's Almanack.&mdash;How the holy man managed the affair,
unless he spent the greatest part of his time in combing his
whiskers, or playing at primero with his chaplain,&mdash;would pose
any mortal not let into the true secret;&mdash;and therefore 'tis
worth explaining to the world, was it only for the encouragement of
those few in it, who write not so much to be fed&mdash;as to be
famous.</p>
<p>I own had John de la Casse, the archbishop of Benevento, for
whose memory (notwithstanding his Galatea,) I retain the highest
veneration,&mdash;had he been, Sir, a slender clerk&mdash;of dull
wit&mdash;slow parts&mdash;costive head, and so forth,&mdash;he and
his Galatea might have jogged on together to the age of Methuselah
for me,&mdash;the phaenomenon had not been worth a
parenthesis.&mdash;</p>
<p>But the reverse of this was the truth: John de la Casse was a
genius of fine parts and fertile fancy; and yet with all these
great advantages of nature, which should have pricked him forwards
with his Galatea, he lay under an impuissance at the same time of
advancing above a line and a half in the compass of a whole
summer's day: this disability in his Grace arose from an opinion he
was afflicted with,&mdash;which opinion was this,&mdash;viz. that
whenever a Christian was writing a book (not for his private
amusement, but) where his intent and purpose was, bona fide, to
print and publish it to the world, his first thoughts were always
the temptations of the evil one.&mdash;This was the state of
ordinary writers: but when a personage of venerable character and
high station, either in church or state, once turned
author,&mdash;he maintained, that from the very moment he took pen
in hand&mdash;all the devils in hell broke out of their holes to
cajole him.&mdash;'Twas Term-time with them,&mdash;every thought,
first and last, was captious;&mdash;how specious and good
soever,&mdash;'twas all one;&mdash;in whatever form or colour it
presented itself to the imagination,&mdash;'twas still a stroke of
one or other of 'em levell'd at him, and was to be fenced
off.&mdash;So that the life of a writer, whatever he might fancy to
the contrary, was not so much a state of composition, as a state of
warfare; and his probation in it, precisely that of any other man
militant upon earth,&mdash;both depending alike, not half so much
upon the degrees of his wit&mdash;as his Resistance.</p>
<p>My father was hugely pleased with this theory of John de la
Casse, archbishop of Benevento; and (had it not cramped him a
little in his creed) I believe would have given ten of the best
acres in the Shandy estate, to have been the broacher of
it.&mdash;How far my father actually believed in the devil, will be
seen, when I come to speak of my father's religious notions, in the
progress of this work: 'tis enough to say here, as he could not
have the honour of it, in the literal sense of the
doctrine&mdash;he took up with the allegory of it; and would often
say, especially when his pen was a little retrograde, there was as
much good meaning, truth, and knowledge, couched under the veil of
John de la Casse's parabolical representation,&mdash;as was to be
found in any one poetic fiction or mystic record of
antiquity.&mdash;Prejudice of education, he would say, is the
devil,&mdash;and the multitudes of them which we suck in with our
mother's milk&mdash;are the devil and all.&mdash;We are haunted
with them, brother Toby, in all our lucubrations and researches;
and was a man fool enough to submit tamely to what they obtruded
upon him,&mdash;what would his book be? Nothing,&mdash;he would
add, throwing his pen away with a vengeance,&mdash;nothing but a
farrago of the clack of nurses, and of the nonsense of the old
women (of both sexes) throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow
progress my father made in his Tristra-paedia; at which (as I said)
he was three years, and something more, indefatigably at work, and,
at last, had scarce completed, by this own reckoning, one half of
his undertaking: the misfortune was, that I was all that time
totally neglected and abandoned to my mother; and what was almost
as bad, by the very delay, the first part of the work, upon which
my father had spent the most of his pains, was rendered entirely
useless,&mdash;every day a page or two became of no
consequence.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the pride of
human wisdom, That the wisest of us all should thus outwit
ourselves, and eternally forego our purposes in the intemperate act
of pursuing them.</p>
<p>In short my father was so long in all his acts of
resistance,&mdash;or in other words,&mdash;he advanced so very slow
with his work, and I began to live and get forwards at such a rate,
that if an event had not happened,&mdash;which, when we get to it,
if it can be told with decency, shall not be concealed a moment
from the reader&mdash;I verily believe, I had put by my father, and
left him drawing a sundial, for no better purpose than to be buried
under ground.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XVII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;'Twas nothing,&mdash;I did not lose two drops of blood by
it&mdash;'twas not worth calling in a surgeon, had he lived next
door to us&mdash;thousands suffer by choice, what I did by
accident.&mdash;Doctor Slop made ten times more of it, than there
was occasion:&mdash;some men rise, by the art of hanging great
weights upon small wires,&mdash;and I am this day (August the 10th,
1761) paying part of the price of this man's reputation.&mdash;O
'twould provoke a stone, to see how things are carried on in this
world!&mdash;The chamber-maid had left no .......... under the
bed:&mdash;Cannot you contrive, master, quoth Susannah, lifting up
the sash with one hand, as she spoke, and helping me up into the
window-seat with the other,&mdash;cannot you manage, my dear, for a
single time, to..................?</p>
<p>I was five years old.&mdash;Susannah did not consider that
nothing was well hung in our family,&mdash;so slap came the sash
down like lightning upon us;&mdash;Nothing is left,&mdash;cried
Susannah,&mdash;nothing is left&mdash;for me, but to run my
country.&mdash;My uncle Toby's house was a much kinder sanctuary;
and so Susannah fled to it.</p>

<p>When Susannah told the corporal the misadventure of the sash,
with all the circumstances which attended the murder of
me,&mdash;(as she called it,)&mdash;the blood forsook his
cheeks,&mdash;all accessaries in murder being
principals,&mdash;Trim's conscience told him he was as much to
blame as Susannah,&mdash;and if the doctrine had been true, my
uncle Toby had as much of the bloodshed to answer for to heaven, as
either of 'em;&mdash;so that neither reason or instinct, separate
or together, could possibly have guided Susannah's steps to so
proper an asylum. It is in vain to leave this to the Reader's
imagination:&mdash;to form any kind of hypothesis that will render
these propositions feasible, he must cudgel his brains
sore,&mdash;and to do it without,&mdash;he must have such brains as
no reader ever had before him.&mdash;Why should I put them either
to trial or to torture? 'Tis my own affair: I'll explain it
myself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XIX.</h2>
<p>'Tis a pity, Trim, said my uncle Toby, resting with his hand
upon the corporal's shoulder, as they both stood surveying their
works,&mdash;that we have not a couple of field-pieces to mount in
the gorge of that new redoubt;&mdash;'twould secure the lines all
along there, and make the attack on that side quite
complete:&mdash;get me a couple cast, Trim.</p>
<p>Your honour shall have them, replied Trim, before tomorrow
morning.</p>
<p>It was the joy of Trim's heart, nor was his fertile head ever at
a loss for expedients in doing it, to supply my uncle Toby in his
campaigns, with whatever his fancy called for; had it been his last
crown, he would have sate down and hammered it into a paderero, to
have prevented a single wish in his master. The corporal had
already,&mdash;what with cutting off the ends of my uncle Toby's
spouts&mdash;hacking and chiseling up the sides of his leaden
gutters,&mdash;melting down his pewter shaving-bason,&mdash;and
going at last, like Lewis the Fourteenth, on to the top of the
church, for spare ends, &amp;c.&mdash;he had that very campaign
brought no less than eight new battering cannons, besides three
demi-culverins, into the field; my uncle Toby's demand for two more
pieces for the redoubt, had set the corporal at work again; and no
better resource offering, he had taken the two leaden weights from
the nursery window: and as the sash pullies, when the lead was
gone, were of no kind of use, he had taken them away also, to make
a couple of wheels for one of their carriages.</p>
<p>He had dismantled every sash-window in my uncle Toby's house
long before, in the very same way,&mdash;though not always in the
same order; for sometimes the pullies have been wanted, and not the
lead,&mdash;so then he began with the pullies,&mdash;and the
pullies being picked out, then the lead became useless,&mdash;and
so the lead went to pot too.</p>
<p>&mdash;A great Moral might be picked handsomely out of this, but
I have not time&mdash;'tis enough to say, wherever the demolition
began, 'twas equally fatal to the sash window.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XX.</h2>
<p>The corporal had not taken his measures so badly in this stroke
of artilleryship, but that he might have kept the matter entirely
to himself, and left Susannah to have sustained the whole weight of
the attack, as she could;&mdash;true courage is not content with
coming off so.&mdash;The corporal, whether as general or
comptroller of the train,&mdash;'twas no matter,&mdash;had done
that, without which, as he imagined, the misfortune could never
have happened,&mdash;at least in Susannah's hands;&mdash;How would
your honours have behaved?&mdash;He determined at once, not to take
shelter behind Susannah,&mdash;but to give it; and with this
resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into the parlour, to
lay the whole manoeuvre before my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby had just then been giving Yorick an account of the
Battle of Steenkirk, and of the strange conduct of count Solmes in
ordering the foot to halt, and the horse to march where it could
not act; which was directly contrary to the king's commands, and
proved the loss of the day.</p>
<p>There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of
what is going to follow,&mdash;they are scarce exceeded by the
invention of a dramatic writer;&mdash;I mean of ancient
days.&mdash;</p>
<p>Trim, by the help of his fore-finger, laid flat upon the table,
and the edge of his hand striking across it at right angles, made a
shift to tell his story so, that priests and virgins might have
listened to it;&mdash;and the story being told,&mdash;the dialogue
went on as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXI.</h2>
<p>&mdash;I would be picquetted to death, cried the corporal, as he
concluded Susannah's story, before I would suffer the woman to come
to any harm,&mdash;'twas my fault, an' please your
honour,&mdash;not her's.</p>
<p>Corporal Trim, replied my uncle Toby, putting on his hat which
lay upon the table,&mdash;if any thing can be said to be a fault,
when the service absolutely requires it should be done,&mdash;'tis
I certainly who deserve the blame,&mdash;you obeyed your
orders.</p>
<p>Had count Solmes, Trim, done the same at the battle of
Steenkirk, said Yorick, drolling a little upon the corporal, who
had been run over by a dragoon in the retreat,&mdash;he had saved
thee;&mdash;Saved! cried Trim, interrupting Yorick, and finishing
the sentence for him after his own fashion,&mdash;he had saved five
battalions, an' please your reverence, every soul of
them:&mdash;there was Cutt's,&mdash;continued the corporal,
clapping the forefinger of his right hand upon the thumb of his
left, and counting round his hand,&mdash;there was
Cutt's,&mdash;Mackay's,&mdash;Angus's,&mdash;Graham's,&mdash;and
Leven's, all cut to pieces;&mdash;and so had the English
life-guards too, had it not been for some regiments upon the right,
who marched up boldly to their relief, and received the enemy's
fire in their faces, before any one of their own platoons
discharged a musket,&mdash;they'll go to heaven for it,&mdash;added
Trim.&mdash;Trim is right, said my uncle Toby, nodding to
Yorick,&mdash;he's perfectly right. What signified his marching the
horse, continued the corporal, where the ground was so strait, that
the French had such a nation of hedges, and copses, and ditches,
and fell'd trees laid this way and that to cover them (as they
always have).&mdash;Count Solmes should have sent us,&mdash;we
would have fired muzzle to muzzle with them for their
lives.&mdash;There was nothing to be done for the horse:&mdash;he
had his foot shot off however for his pains, continued the
corporal, the very next campaign at Landen.&mdash;Poor Trim got his
wound there, quoth my uncle Toby.&mdash;'Twas owing, an' please
your honour, entirely to count Solmes,&mdash;had he drubbed them
soundly at Steenkirk, they would not have fought us at
Landen.&mdash;Possibly not,&mdash;Trim, said my uncle
Toby;&mdash;though if they have the advantage of a wood, or you
give them a moment's time to intrench themselves, they are a nation
which will pop and pop for ever at you.&mdash;There is no way but
to march coolly up to them,&mdash;receive their fire, and fall in
upon them, pell-mell&mdash;Ding dong, added Trim.&mdash;Horse and
foot, said my uncle Toby.&mdash;Helter Skelter, said
Trim.&mdash;Right and left, cried my uncle Toby.&mdash;Blood an'
ounds, shouted the corporal;&mdash;the battle raged,&mdash;Yorick
drew his chair a little to one side for safety, and after a
moment's pause, my uncle Toby sinking his voice a
note,&mdash;resumed the discourse as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXII.</h2>
<p>King William, said my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Yorick,
was so terribly provoked at count Solmes for disobeying his orders,
that he would not suffer him to come into his presence for many
months after.&mdash;I fear, answered Yorick, the squire will be as
much provoked at the corporal, as the King at the count.&mdash;But
'twould be singularly hard in this case, continued be, if corporal
Trim, who has behaved so diametrically opposite to count Solmes,
should have the fate to be rewarded with the same
disgrace:&mdash;too oft in this world, do things take that
train.&mdash;I would spring a mine, cried my uncle Toby, rising
up,&mdash;and blow up my fortifications, and my house with them,
and we would perish under their ruins, ere I would stand by and see
it.&mdash;Trim directed a slight,&mdash;but a grateful bow towards
his master,&mdash;and so the chapter ends.</p>

the way abreast,&mdash;and do you, corporal, follow a few paces
behind us.&mdash;And Susannah, an' please your honour, said Trim,
shall be put in the rear.&mdash;'Twas an excellent
disposition,&mdash;and in this order, without either drums beating,
or colours flying, they marched slowly from my uncle Toby's house
to Shandy-hall.</p>
<p>&mdash;I wish, said Trim, as they entered the
door,&mdash;instead of the sash weights, I had cut off the church
spout, as I once thought to have done.&mdash;You have cut off
spouts enow, replied Yorick.</p>

<p>As many pictures as have been given of my father, how like him
soever in different airs and attitudes,&mdash;not one, or all of
them, can ever help the reader to any kind of preconception of how
my father would think, speak, or act, upon any untried occasion or
occurrence of life.&mdash;There was that infinitude of oddities in
him, and of chances along with it, by which handle he would take a
thing,&mdash;it baffled, Sir, all calculations.&mdash;The truth
was, his road lay so very far on one side, from that wherein most
men travelled,&mdash;that every object before him presented a face
and section of itself to his eye, altogether different from the
plan and elevation of it seen by the rest of mankind.&mdash;In
other words, 'twas a different object, and in course was
differently considered:</p>
<p>This is the true reason, that my dear Jenny and I, as well as
all the world besides us, have such eternal squabbles about
nothing.&mdash;She looks at her outside,&mdash;I, at her in.... How

<h2>Chapter 3.XXVI.</h2>
<p>Fifty thousand pannier loads of devils&mdash;(not of the
Archbishop of Benevento's&mdash;I mean of Rabelais's devils), with
their tails chopped off by their rumps, could not have made so
diabolical a scream of it, as I did&mdash;when the accident befel
me: it summoned up my mother instantly into the nursery,&mdash;so
that Susannah had but just time to make her escape down the back
stairs, as my mother came up the fore.</p>
<p>Now, though I was old enough to have told the story
myself,&mdash;and young enough, I hope, to have done it without
malignity; yet Susannah, in passing by the kitchen, for fear of
accidents, had left it in short-hand with the cook&mdash;the cook
had told it with a commentary to Jonathan, and Jonathan to Obadiah;
so that by the time my father had rung the bell half a dozen times,
to know what was the matter above,&mdash;was Obadiah enabled to
give him a particular account of it, just as it had
happened.&mdash;I thought as much, said my father, tucking up his
night-gown;&mdash;and so walked up stairs.</p>
<p>One would imagine from this&mdash;(though for my own part I
somewhat question it)&mdash;that my father, before that time, had
actually wrote that remarkable character in the Tristra-paedia,
which to me is the most original and entertaining one in the whole
book;&mdash;and that is the chapter upon sash-windows, with a
bitter Philippick at the end of it, upon the forgetfulness of
chamber-maids.&mdash;I have but two reasons for thinking
otherwise.</p>
<p>First, Had the matter been taken into consideration, before the
event happened, my father certainly would have nailed up the sash
window for good an' all;&mdash;which, considering with what
difficulty he composed books,&mdash;he might have done with ten
times less trouble, than he could have wrote the chapter: this
argument I foresee holds good against his writing a chapter, even
after the event; but 'tis obviated under the second reason, which I
have the honour to offer to the world in support of my opinion,
that my father did not write the chapter upon sash-windows and
chamber-pots, at the time supposed,&mdash;and it is this.</p>
<p>&mdash;That, in order to render the Tristra-paedia
complete,&mdash;I wrote the chapter myself.</p>

<p>My father put on his spectacles&mdash;looked,&mdash;took them
off,&mdash;put them into the case&mdash;all in less than a
statutable minute; and without opening his lips, turned about and
walked precipitately down stairs: my mother imagined he had stepped
down for lint and basilicon; but seeing him return with a couple of
folios under his arm, and Obadiah following him with a large
reading-desk, she took it for granted 'twas an herbal, and so drew
him a chair to the bedside, that he might consult upon the case at
his ease.</p>
<p>&mdash;If it be but right done,&mdash;said my father, turning to
the Section&mdash;de sede vel subjecto circumcisionis,&mdash;for he

Maimonides, in order to confront and examine us
altogether.&mdash;</p>

cried my mother, interrupting him, what herbs?&mdash;For that,
replied my father, you must send for Dr. Slop.</p>
<p>My mother went down, and my father went on, reading the section
as follows,</p>
<p>...&mdash;Very well,&mdash;said my father,...&mdash;nay, if it
has that convenience&mdash;and so without stopping a moment to
settle it first in his mind, whether the Jews had it from the
Egyptians, or the Egyptians from the Jews,&mdash;he rose up, and
rubbing his forehead two or three times across with the palm of his
hand, in the manner we rub out the footsteps of care, when evil has
trod lighter upon us than we foreboded,&mdash;he shut the book, and
walked down stairs.&mdash;Nay, said he, mentioning the name of a
different great nation upon every step as he set his foot upon
it&mdash;if the Egyptians,&mdash;the Syrians,&mdash;the
Phoenicians,&mdash;the Arabians,&mdash;the Cappadocians,&mdash;if
the Colchi, and Troglodytes did it&mdash;if Solon and Pythagoras

<h2>Chapter 3.XXVIII.</h2>
<p>Dear Yorick, said my father smiling (for Yorick had broke his
rank with my uncle Toby in coming through the narrow entry, and so
had stept first into the parlour)&mdash;this Tristram of ours, I
find, comes very hardly by all his religious rites.&mdash;Never was
the son of Jew, Christian, Turk, or Infidel initiated into them in
so oblique and slovenly a manner.&mdash;But he is no worse, I
trust, said Yorick.&mdash;There has been certainly, continued my
father, the deuce and all to do in some part or other of the
ecliptic, when this offspring of mine was formed.&mdash;That, you
are a better judge of than I, replied Yorick.&mdash;Astrologers,
quoth my father, know better than us both:&mdash;the trine and
sextil aspects have jumped awry,&mdash;or the opposite of their
ascendents have not hit it, as they should,&mdash;or the lords of
the genitures (as they call them) have been at bo-peep,&mdash;or
something has been wrong above, or below with us.</p>
<p>'Tis possible, answered Yorick.&mdash;But is the child, cried my
uncle Toby, the worse?&mdash;The Troglodytes say not, replied my
father. And your theologists, Yorick, tell us&mdash;Theologically?
said Yorick,&mdash;or speaking after the manner of apothecaries?
(footnote in Greek Philo.)&mdash;statesmen? (footnote in
Greek)&mdash;or washer-women? (footnote in Greek Bochart.)</p>
<p>&mdash;I'm not sure, replied my father,&mdash;but they tell us,
brother Toby, he's the better for it.&mdash;Provided, said Yorick,
you travel him into Egypt.&mdash;Of that, answered my father, he
will have the advantage, when he sees the Pyramids.&mdash;</p>
<p>Now every word of this, quoth my uncle Toby, is Arabic to
me.&mdash;I wish, said Yorick, 'twas so, to half the world.</p>
<p>&mdash;Ilus, (footnote in Greek Sanchuniatho.) continued my
father, circumcised his whole army one morning.&mdash;Not without a
court martial? cried my uncle Toby.&mdash;Though the learned,
continued he, taking no notice of my uncle Toby's remark, but
turning to Yorick,&mdash;are greatly divided still who Ilus
was;&mdash;some say Saturn;&mdash;some the Supreme
Being;&mdash;others, no more than a brigadier general under
Pharaoh-neco.&mdash;Let him be who he will, said my uncle Toby, I
know not by what article of war he could justify it.</p>
<p>The controvertists, answered my father, assign two-and-twenty
different reasons for it:&mdash;others, indeed, who have drawn
their pens on the opposite side of the question, have shewn the
world the futility of the greatest part of them.&mdash;But then
again, our best polemic divines&mdash;I wish there was not a
polemic divine, said Yorick, in the kingdom;&mdash;one ounce of
practical divinity&mdash;is worth a painted ship-load of all their
reverences have imported these fifty years.&mdash;Pray, Mr. Yorick,
quoth my uncle Toby,&mdash;do tell me what a polemic divine
is?&mdash;The best description, captain Shandy, I have ever read,
is of a couple of 'em, replied Yorick, in the account of the battle
fought single hands betwixt Gymnast and captain Tripet; which I
have in my pocket.&mdash;I beg I may hear it, quoth my uncle Toby
earnestly.&mdash;You shall, said Yorick.&mdash;And as the corporal
is waiting for me at the door,&mdash;and I know the description of
a battle will do the poor fellow more good than his supper,&mdash;I
beg, brother, you'll give him leave to come in.&mdash;With all my
soul, said my father.&mdash;Trim came in, erect and happy as an
emperor; and having shut the door, Yorick took a book from his
right-hand coat-pocket, and read, or pretended to read, as
follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXIX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;'which words being heard by all the soldiers which were
there, divers of them being inwardly terrified, did shrink back and
make room for the assailant: all this did Gymnast very well remark
and consider; and therefore, making as if he would have alighted
from off his horse, as he was poising himself on the mounting side,
he most nimbly (with his short sword by this thigh) shifting his
feet in the stirrup, and performing the stirrup-leather feat,
whereby, after the inclining of his body downwards, he forthwith
launched himself aloft into the air, and placed both his feet
together upon the saddle, standing upright, with his back turned
towards his horse's head,&mdash;Now, (said he) my case goes
forward. Then suddenly in the same posture wherein he was, he
fetched a gambol upon one foot, and turning to the left-hand,
failed not to carry his body perfectly round, just into his former
position, without missing one jot.&mdash;Ha! said Tripet, I will
not do that at this time,&mdash;and not without cause. Well, said
Gymnast, I have failed,&mdash;I will undo this leap; then with a
marvellous strength and agility, turning towards the right-hand, he
fetched another striking gambol as before; which done, he set his
right hand thumb upon the bow of the saddle, raised himself up, and
sprung into the air, poising and upholding his whole weight upon
the muscle and nerve of the said thumb, and so turned and whirled
himself about three times: at the fourth, reversing his body, and
overturning it upside down, and foreside back, without touching any
thing, he brought himself betwixt the horse's two ears, and then
giving himself a jerking swing, he seated himself upon the
crupper&mdash;'</p>
<p>(This can't be fighting, said my uncle Toby.&mdash;The corporal
shook his head at it.&mdash;Have patience, said Yorick.)</p>
<p>'Then (Tripet) pass'd his right leg over his saddle, and placed
himself en croup.&mdash;But, said he, 'twere better for me to get
into the saddle; then putting the thumbs of both hands upon the
crupper before him, and there-upon leaning himself, as upon the
only supporters of his body, he incontinently turned heels over
head in the air, and strait found himself betwixt the bow of the
saddle in a tolerable seat; then springing into the air with a
summerset, he turned him about like a wind-mill, and made above a
hundred frisks, turns, and demi-pommadas.'&mdash;Good God! cried
Trim, losing all patience,&mdash;one home thrust of a bayonet is
worth it all.&mdash;I think so too, replied Yorick.&mdash;</p>
<p>I am of a contrary opinion, quoth my father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;No,&mdash;I think I have advanced nothing, replied my
father, making answer to a question which Yorick had taken the
liberty to put to him,&mdash;I have advanced nothing in the
Tristra-paedia, but what is as clear as any one proposition in
Euclid.&mdash;Reach me, Trim, that book from off the
scrutoir:&mdash;it has oft-times been in my mind, continued my
father, to have read it over both to you, Yorick, and to my brother
Toby, and I think it a little unfriendly in myself, in not having
done it long ago:&mdash;shall we have a short chapter or two
now,&mdash;and a chapter or two hereafter, as occasions serve; and
so on, till we get through the whole? My uncle Toby and Yorick made
the obeisance which was proper; and the corporal, though he was not
included in the compliment, laid his hand upon his breast, and made
his bow at the same time.&mdash;The company smiled. Trim, quoth my
father, has paid the full price for staying out the
entertainment.&mdash;He did not seem to relish the play, replied
Yorick.&mdash;'Twas a Tom-fool-battle, an' please your reverence,
of captain Tripet's and that other officer, making so many
summersets, as they advanced;&mdash;the French come on capering now
and then in that way,&mdash;but not quite so much.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby never felt the consciousness of his existence with
more complacency than what the corporal's, and his own reflections,
made him do at that moment;&mdash;he lighted his pipe,&mdash;Yorick
drew his chair closer to the table,&mdash;Trim snuff'd the
candle,&mdash;my father stirr'd up the fire,&mdash;took up the

<h2>Chapter 3.XXXI.</h2>
<p>The first thirty pages, said my father, turning over the
leaves,&mdash;are a little dry; and as they are not closely
connected with the subject,&mdash;for the present we'll pass them
by: 'tis a prefatory introduction, continued my father, or an
introductory preface (for I am not determined which name to give
it) upon political or civil government; the foundation of which
being laid in the first conjunction betwixt male and female, for
procreation of the species&mdash;I was insensibly led into
it.&mdash;'Twas natural, said Yorick.</p>
<p>The original of society, continued my father, I'm satisfied is,
what Politian tells us, i. e. merely conjugal; and nothing more
than the getting together of one man and one woman;&mdash;to which,
(according to Hesiod) the philosopher adds a servant:&mdash;but
supposing in the first beginning there were no men servants
born&mdash;he lays the foundation of it, in a man,&mdash;a
woman&mdash;and a bull.&mdash;I believe 'tis an ox, quoth Yorick,
quoting the passage (Greek)&mdash;A bull must have given more
trouble than his head was worth.&mdash;But there is a better reason
still, said my father (dipping his pen into his ink); for the ox
being the most patient of animals, and the most useful withal in
tilling the ground for their nourishment,&mdash;was the properest
instrument, and emblem too, for the new joined couple, that the
creation could have associated with them.&mdash;And there is a
stronger reason, added my uncle Toby, than them all for the
ox.&mdash;My father had not power to take his pen out of his
ink-horn, till he had heard my uncle Toby's reason.&mdash;For when
the ground was tilled, said my uncle Toby, and made worth
inclosing, then they began to secure it by walls and ditches, which
was the origin of fortification.&mdash;True, true, dear Toby, cried
my father, striking out the bull, and putting the ox in his
place.</p>
<p>My father gave Trim a nod, to snuff the candle, and resumed his
discourse.</p>
<p>&mdash;I enter upon this speculation, said my father carelessly,
and half shutting the book, as he went on, merely to shew the
foundation of the natural relation between a father and his child;
the right and jurisdiction over whom he acquires these several
ways&mdash;</p>
<p>1st, by marriage.</p>
<p>2d, by adoption.</p>
<p>3d, by legitimation.</p>
<p>And 4th, by procreation; all which I consider in their
order.</p>
<p>I lay a slight stress upon one of them, replied Yorick&mdash;the
act, especially where it ends there, in my opinion lays as little
obligation upon the child, as it conveys power to the
father.&mdash;You are wrong,&mdash;said my father argutely, and for
this plain reason....&mdash;I own, added my father, that the
offspring, upon this account, is not so under the power and
jurisdiction of the mother.&mdash;But the reason, replied Yorick,
equally holds good for her.&mdash;She is under authority herself,
said my father:&mdash;and besides, continued my father, nodding his
head, and laying his finger upon the side of his nose, as he
assigned his reason,&mdash;she is not the principal agent,
Yorick.&mdash;In what, quoth my uncle Toby? stopping his
pipe.&mdash;Though by all means, added my father (not attending to
my uncle Toby), 'The son ought to pay her respect,' as you may
read, Yorick, at large in the first book of the Institutes of
Justinian, at the eleventh title and the tenth section.&mdash;I can
read it as well, replied Yorick, in the Catechism.</p>

<p>Trim can repeat every word of it by heart, quoth my uncle
Toby.&mdash;Pugh! said my father, not caring to be interrupted with
Trim's saying his Catechism. He can, upon my honour, replied my
uncle Toby.&mdash;Ask him, Mr. Yorick, any question you
please.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The fifth Commandment, Trim,&mdash;said Yorick, speaking
mildly, and with a gentle nod, as to a modest Catechumen. The
corporal stood silent.&mdash;You don't ask him right, said my uncle
Toby, raising his voice, and giving it rapidly like the word of
command:&mdash;The fifth&mdash;cried my uncle Toby.&mdash;I must
begin with the first, an' please your honour, said the
corporal.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Yorick could not forbear smiling.&mdash;Your reverence
does not consider, said the corporal, shouldering his stick like a
musket, and marching into the middle of the room, to illustrate his
position,&mdash;that 'tis exactly the same thing, as doing one's
exercise in the field.&mdash;</p>
<p>'Join your right-hand to your firelock,' cried the corporal,
giving the word of command, and performing the motion.&mdash;</p>
<p>'Poise your firelock,' cried the corporal, doing the duty still
both of adjutant and private man.</p>
<p>'Rest your firelock;'&mdash;one motion, an' please your
reverence, you see leads into another.&mdash;If his honour will
begin but with the first&mdash;</p>
<p>The First&mdash;cried my uncle Toby, setting his hand upon his
side&mdash;....</p>
<p>The Second&mdash;cried my uncle Toby, waving his tobacco-pipe,
as he would have done his sword at the head of a
regiment.&mdash;The corporal went through his manual with
exactness; and having honoured his father and mother, made a low
bow, and fell back to the side of the room.</p>
<p>Every thing in this world, said my father, is big with jest, and
has wit in it, and instruction too,&mdash;if we can but find it
out.</p>
<p>&mdash;Here is the scaffold work of Instruction, its true point
of folly, without the Building behind it.</p>
<p>&mdash;Here is the glass for pedagogues, preceptors, tutors,
governors, gerund-grinders, and bear-leaders to view themselves in,
in their true dimensions.&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh! there is a husk and shell, Yorick, which grows up with
learning, which their unskilfulness knows not how to fling
away!</p>
<p>&mdash;Sciences May Be Learned by Rote But Wisdom Not.</p>
<p>Yorick thought my father inspired.&mdash;I will enter into
obligations this moment, said my father, to lay out all my aunt
Dinah's legacy in charitable uses (of which, by the bye, my father
had no high opinion), if the corporal has any one determinate idea
annexed to any one word he has repeated.&mdash;Prithee, Trim, quoth
my father, turning round to him,&mdash;What dost thou mean, by
'honouring thy father and mother?'</p>
<p>Allowing them, an' please your honour, three halfpence a day out
of my pay, when they grow old.&mdash;And didst thou do that, Trim?
said Yorick.&mdash;He did indeed, replied my uncle
Toby.&mdash;Then, Trim, said Yorick, springing out of his chair,
and taking the corporal by the hand, thou art the best commentator
upon that part of the Decalogue; and I honour thee more for it,
corporal Trim, than if thou hadst had a hand in the Talmud
itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXXIII.</h2>
<p>O blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he
turned over the leaves to the next chapter, thou art before all
gold and treasure; 'tis thou who enlargest the soul,&mdash;and
openest all its powers to receive instruction and to relish
virtue.&mdash;He that has thee, has little more to wish
for;&mdash;and he that is so wretched as to want thee,&mdash;wants
every thing with thee.</p>
<p>I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important
head, said my father, into a very little room, therefore we'll read
the chapter quite through.</p>
<p>My father read as follows:</p>
<p>'The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention
for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical
moisture'&mdash;You have proved that matter of fact, I suppose,
above, said Yorick. Sufficiently, replied my father.</p>
<p>In saying this, my father shut the book,&mdash;not as if he
resolved to read no more of it, for he kept his fore-finger in the
chapter:&mdash;nor pettishly,&mdash;for he shut the book slowly;
his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upper-side of the
cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side of it, without
the least compressive violence.&mdash;</p>
<p>I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father,
nodding to Yorick, most sufficiently in the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth
had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of
all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the
radical heat and the radical moisture,&mdash;and that he had
managed the point so well, that there was not one single word wet
or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout the whole
chapter,&mdash;or a single syllable in it, pro or con, directly or
indirectly, upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any
part of the animal oeconomy&mdash;</p>
<p>'O thou eternal Maker of all beings!'&mdash;he would cry,
striking his breast with his right hand (in case he had
one)&mdash;'Thou whose power and goodness can enlarge the faculties
of thy creatures to this infinite degree of excellence and
perfection,&mdash;What have we Moonites done?'</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXXIV.</h2>
<p>With two strokes, the one at Hippocrates, the other at Lord
Verulam, did my father achieve it.</p>
<p>The stroke at the prince of physicians, with which he began, was
no more than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the Ars
longa,&mdash;and Vita brevis.&mdash;Life short, cried my
father,&mdash;and the art of healing tedious! And who are we to
thank for both the one and the other, but the ignorance of quacks
themselves,&mdash;and the stage-loads of chymical nostrums, and
peripatetic lumber, with which, in all ages, they have first
flatter'd the world, and at last deceived it?</p>
<p>&mdash;O my lord Verulam! cried my father, turning from
Hippocrates, and making his second stroke at him, as the principal
of nostrum-mongers, and the fittest to be made an example of to the
rest,&mdash;What shall I say to thee, my great lord Verulam? What
shall I say to thy internal spirit,&mdash;thy opium, thy
salt-petre,&mdash;thy greasy unctions,&mdash;thy daily
purges,&mdash;thy nightly clysters, and succedaneums?</p>
<p>&mdash;My father was never at a loss what to say to any man,
upon any subject; and had the least occasion for the exordium of
any man breathing: how he dealt with his lordship's
opinion,&mdash;you shall see;&mdash;but when&mdash;I know
not:&mdash;we must first see what his lordship's opinion was.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXXV.</h2>
<p>'The two great causes, which conspire with each other to shorten
life, says lord Verulam, are first&mdash;</p>
<p>'The internal spirit, which like a gentle flame wastes the body
down to death:&mdash;And secondly, the external air, that parches
the body up to ashes:&mdash;which two enemies attacking us on both
sides of our bodies together, at length destroy our organs, and
render them unfit to carry on the functions of life.'</p>
<p>This being the state of the case, the road to longevity was
plain; nothing more being required, says his lordship, but to
repair the waste committed by the internal spirit, by making the
substance of it more thick and dense, by a regular course of
opiates on one side, and by refrigerating the heat of it on the
other, by three grains and a half of salt-petre every morning
before you got up.&mdash;</p>
<p>Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical
assaults of the air without;&mdash;but this was fenced off again by
a course of greasy unctions, which so fully saturated the pores of
the skin, that no spicula could enter;&mdash;nor could any one get
out.&mdash;This put a stop to all perspiration, sensible and
insensible, which being the cause of so many scurvy
distempers&mdash;a course of clysters was requisite to carry off
redundant humours,&mdash;and render the system complete.</p>
<p>What my father had to say to my lord of Verulam's opiates, his
salt-petre, and greasy unctions and clysters, you shall
read,&mdash;but not to-day&mdash;or to-morrow: time presses upon
me,&mdash;my reader is impatient&mdash;I must get
forwards&mdash;You shall read the chapter at your leisure (if you
chuse it), as soon as ever the Tristra-paedia is
published.&mdash;</p>
<p>Sufficeth it, at present to say, my father levelled the
hypothesis with the ground, and in doing that, the learned know, he
built up and established his own.&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXXVI.</h2>
<p>The whole secret of health, said my father, beginning the
sentence again, depending evidently upon the due contention betwixt
the radical heat and radical moisture within us;&mdash;the least
imaginable skill had been sufficient to have maintained it, had not
the school-men confounded the task, merely (as Van Helmont, the
famous chymist, has proved) by all along mistaking the radical
moisture for the tallow and fat of animal bodies.</p>
<p>Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals,
but an oily and balsamous substance; for the fat and tallow, as
also the phlegm or watery parts, are cold; whereas the oily and
balsamous parts are of a lively heat and spirit, which accounts for
the observation of Aristotle, 'Quod omne animal post coitum est
triste.'</p>
<p>Now it is certain, that the radical heat lives in the radical
moisture, but whether vice versa, is a doubt: however, when the one
decays, the other decays also; and then is produced, either an
unnatural heat, which causes an unnatural dryness&mdash;or an
unnatural moisture, which causes dropsies.&mdash;So that if a
child, as he grows up, can but be taught to avoid running into fire
or water, as either of 'em threaten his destruction,&mdash;'twill
be all that is needful to be done upon that head.&mdash;</p>

<p>The description of the siege of Jericho itself, could not have
engaged the attention of my uncle Toby more powerfully than the
last chapter;&mdash;his eyes were fixed upon my father throughout
it;&mdash;he never mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but
my uncle Toby took his pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head;
and as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the
corporal to come close to his chair, to ask him the following
question,&mdash;aside.&mdash;.... It was at the siege of Limerick,
an' please your honour, replied the corporal, making a bow.</p>
<p>The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself
to my father, were scarce able to crawl out of our tents, at the
time the siege of Limerick was raised, upon the very account you
mention.&mdash;Now what can have got into that precious noddle of
thine, my dear brother Toby? cried my father, mentally.&mdash;By
Heaven! continued he, communing still with himself, it would puzzle
an Oedipus to bring it in point.&mdash;</p>
<p>I believe, an' please your honour, quoth the corporal, that if
it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every
night, and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour
off;&mdash;And the geneva, Trim, added my uncle Toby, which did us
more good than all&mdash;I verily believe, continued the corporal,
we had both, an' please your honour, left our lives in the
trenches, and been buried in them too.&mdash;The noblest grave,
corporal! cried my uncle Toby, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that
a soldier could wish to lie down in.&mdash;But a pitiful death for
him! an' please your honour, replied the corporal.</p>
<p>All this was as much Arabick to my father, as the rites of the
Colchi and Troglodites had been before to my uncle Toby; my father
could not determine whether he was to frown or to smile.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby, turning to Yorick, resumed the case at Limerick,
more intelligibly than he had begun it,&mdash;and so settled the
point for my father at once.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XXXVIII.</h2>
<p>It was undoubtedly, said my uncle Toby, a great happiness for
myself and the corporal, that we had all along a burning fever,
attended with a most raging thirst, during the whole
five-and-twenty days the flux was upon us in the camp; otherwise
what my brother calls the radical moisture, must, as I conceive it,
inevitably have got the better.&mdash;My father drew in his lungs
top-full of air, and looking up, blew it forth again, as slowly as
he possibly could.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It was Heaven's mercy to us, continued my uncle Toby,
which put it into the corporal's head to maintain that due
contention betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture, by
reinforceing the fever, as he did all along, with hot wine and
spices; whereby the corporal kept up (as it were) a continual
firing, so that the radical heat stood its ground from the
beginning to the end, and was a fair match for the moisture,
terrible as it was.&mdash;Upon my honour, added my uncle Toby, you
might have heard the contention within our bodies, brother Shandy,
twenty toises.&mdash;If there was no firing, said Yorick.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;said my father, with a full aspiration, and pausing a
while after the word&mdash;Was I a judge, and the laws of the
country which made me one permitted it, I would condemn some of the
worst malefactors, provided they had had their
clergy...&mdash;Yorick, foreseeing the sentence was likely to end
with no sort of mercy, laid his hand upon my father's breast, and
begged he would respite it for a few minutes, till he asked the
corporal a question.&mdash;Prithee, Trim, said Yorick, without
staying for my father's leave,&mdash;tell us honestly&mdash;what is
thy opinion concerning this self-same radical heat and radical
moisture?</p>
<p>With humble submission to his honour's better judgment, quoth
the corporal, making a bow to my uncle Toby&mdash;Speak thy opinion
freely, corporal, said my uncle Toby.&mdash;The poor fellow is my
servant,&mdash;not my slave,&mdash;added my uncle Toby, turning to
my father.&mdash;</p>
<p>The corporal put his hat under his left arm, and with his stick
hanging upon the wrist of it, by a black thong split into a tassel
about the knot, he marched up to the ground where he had performed
his catechism; then touching his under-jaw with the thumb and
fingers of his right hand before he opened his mouth,&mdash;he
delivered his notion thus.</p>

<p>Just as the corporal was humming, to begin&mdash;in waddled Dr.
Slop.&mdash;'Tis not two-pence matter&mdash;the corporal shall go
on in the next chapter, let who will come in.&mdash;</p>
<p>Well, my good doctor, cried my father sportively, for the
transitions of his passions were unaccountably sudden,&mdash;and
what has this whelp of mine to say to the matter?</p>
<p>Had my father been asking after the amputation of the tail of a
puppy-dog&mdash;he could not have done it in a more careless air:
the system which Dr. Slop had laid down, to treat the accident by,
no way allowed of such a mode of enquiry.&mdash;He sat down.</p>
<p>Pray, Sir, quoth my uncle Toby, in a manner which could not go
unanswered,&mdash;in what condition is the boy?&mdash;'Twill end in
a phimosis, replied Dr. Slop.</p>
<p>I am no wiser than I was, quoth my uncle Toby&mdash;returning
his pipe into his mouth.&mdash;Then let the corporal go on, said my
father, with his medical lecture.&mdash;The corporal made a bow to
his old friend, Dr. Slop, and then delivered his opinion concerning
radical heat and radical moisture, in the following words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XL.</h2>
<p>The city of Limerick, the siege of which was begun under his
majesty king William himself, the year after I went into the
army&mdash;lies, an' please your honours, in the middle of a
devilish wet, swampy country.&mdash;'Tis quite surrounded, said my
uncle Toby, with the Shannon, and is, by its situation, one of the
strongest fortified places in Ireland.&mdash;</p>
<p>I think this is a new fashion, quoth Dr. Slop, of beginning a
medical lecture.&mdash;'Tis all true, answered Trim.&mdash;Then I
wish the faculty would follow the cut of it, said
Yorick.&mdash;'Tis all cut through, an' please your reverence, said
the corporal, with drains and bogs; and besides, there was such a
quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole country was like
a puddle,&mdash;'twas that, and nothing else, which brought on the
flux, and which had like to have killed both his honour and myself;
now there was no such thing, after the first ten days, continued
the corporal, for a soldier to lie dry in his tent, without cutting
a ditch round it, to draw off the water;&mdash;nor was that enough,
for those who could afford it, as his honour could, without setting
fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy, which took off
the damp of the air, and made the inside of the tent as warm as a
stove.&mdash;</p>
<p>And what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal Trim, cried my
father, from all these premises?</p>
<p>I infer, an' please your worship, replied Trim, that the radical
moisture is nothing in the world but ditch-water&mdash;and that the
radical heat, of those who can go to the expence of it, is burnt
brandy,&mdash;the radical heat and moisture of a private man, an'
please your honour, is nothing but ditch-water&mdash;and a dram of
geneva&mdash;and give us but enough of it, with a pipe of tobacco,
to give us spirits, and drive away the vapours&mdash;we know not
what it is to fear death.</p>
<p>I am at a loss, Captain Shandy, quoth Doctor Slop, to determine
in which branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in
physiology or divinity.&mdash;Slop had not forgot Trim's comment
upon the sermon.&mdash;</p>
<p>It is but an hour ago, replied Yorick, since the corporal was
examined in the latter, and passed muster with great
honour.&mdash;</p>
<p>The radical heat and moisture, quoth Doctor Slop, turning to my
father, you must know, is the basis and foundation of our
being&mdash;as the root of a tree is the source and principle of
its vegetation.&mdash;It is inherent in the seeds of all animals,
and may be preserved sundry ways, but principally in my opinion by
consubstantials, impriments, and occludents.&mdash;Now this poor
fellow, continued Dr. Slop, pointing to the corporal, has had the
misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse upon
this nice point.&mdash;That he has,&mdash;said my
father.&mdash;Very likely, said my uncle.&mdash;I'm sure of
it&mdash;quoth Yorick.&mdash;</p>

<h3>&mdash;Five years with a bib under his chin;</h3>
<p>Four years in travelling from Christ-cross-row to Malachi;</p>
<p>A year and a half in learning to write his own name;</p>
<p>Seven long years and more (Greek)-ing it, at Greek and
Latin;</p>
<p>Four years at his probations and his negations&mdash;the fine
statue still lying in the middle of the marble block,&mdash;and
nothing done, but his tools sharpened to hew it out!&mdash;'Tis a
piteous delay!&mdash;Was not the great Julius Scaliger within an
ace of never getting his tools sharpened at all?&mdash;Forty-four
years old was he before he could manage his Greek;&mdash;and Peter
Damianus, lord bishop of Ostia, as all the world knows, could not
so much as read, when he was of man's estate.&mdash;And Baldus
himself, as eminent as he turned out after, entered upon the law so
late in life, that every body imagined he intended to be an
advocate in the other world: no wonder, when Eudamidas, the son of
Archidamas, heard Xenocrates at seventy-five disputing about
wisdom, that he asked gravely,&mdash;If the old man be yet
disputing and enquiring concerning wisdom,&mdash;what time will he
have to make use of it?</p>
<p>Yorick listened to my father with great attention; there was a
seasoning of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest
whims, and he had sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of
his eclipses, as almost atoned for them:&mdash;be wary, Sir, when
you imitate him.</p>
<p>I am convinced, Yorick, continued my father, half reading and
half discoursing, that there is a North-west passage to the
intellectual world; and that the soul of man has shorter ways of
going to work, in furnishing itself with knowledge and instruction,
than we generally take with it.&mdash;But, alack! all fields have
not a river or a spring running besides them;&mdash;every child,
Yorick, has not a parent to point it out.</p>
<p>&mdash;The whole entirely depends, added my father, in a low
voice, upon the auxiliary verbs, Mr. Yorick.</p>
<p>Had Yorick trod upon Virgil's snake, he could not have looked
more surprised.&mdash;I am surprised too, cried my father,
observing it,&mdash;and I reckon it as one of the greatest
calamities which ever befel the republic of letters, That those who
have been entrusted with the education of our children, and whose
business it was to open their minds, and stock them early with
ideas, in order to set the imagination loose upon them, have made
so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it, as they have
done&mdash;So that, except Raymond Lullius, and the elder
Pelegrini, the last of which arrived to such perfection in the use
of 'em, with his topics, that, in a few lessons, he could teach a
young gentleman to discourse with plausibility upon any subject,
pro and con, and to say and write all that could be spoken or
written concerning it, without blotting a word, to the admiration
of all who beheld him.&mdash;I should be glad, said Yorick,
interrupting my father, to be made to comprehend this matter. You
shall, said my father.</p>
<p>The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of,
is a high metaphor,&mdash;for which, in my opinion, the idea is
generally the worse, and not the better;&mdash;but be that as it
may,&mdash;when the mind has done that with it&mdash;there is an
end,&mdash;the mind and the idea are at rest,&mdash;until a second
idea enters;&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>Now the use of the Auxiliaries is, at once to set the soul
a-going by herself upon the materials as they are brought her; and
by the versability of this great engine, round which they are
twisted, to open new tracts of enquiry, and make every idea
engender millions.</p>
<p>You excite my curiosity greatly, said Yorick.</p>
<p>For my own part, quoth my uncle Toby, I have given it
up.&mdash;The Danes, an' please your honour, quoth the corporal,
who were on the left at the siege of Limerick, were all
auxiliaries.&mdash;And very good ones, said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;But the auxiliaries, Trim, my brother is talking
about,&mdash;I conceive to be different things.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;You do? said my father, rising up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XLIII.</h2>
<p>My father took a single turn across the room, then sat down, and
finished the chapter.</p>
<p>The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here, continued my
father, are, am; was; have; had; do; did; make; made; suffer;
shall; should; will; would; can; could; owe; ought; used; or is
wont.&mdash;And these varied with tenses, present, past, future,
and conjugated with the verb see,&mdash;or with these questions
added to them;&mdash;Is it? Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May it
be? Might it be? And these again put negatively, Is it not? Was it
not? Ought it not?&mdash;Or affirmatively,&mdash;It is; It was; It
ought to be. Or chronologically,&mdash;Has it been always? Lately?
How long ago?&mdash;Or hypothetically,&mdash;If it was? If it was
not? What would follow?&mdash;If the French should beat the
English? If the Sun go out of the Zodiac?</p>
<p>Now, by the right use and application of these, continued my
father, in which a child's memory should be exercised, there is no
one idea can enter his brain, how barren soever, but a magazine of
conceptions and conclusions may be drawn forth from it.&mdash;Didst
thou ever see a white bear? cried my father, turning his head round
to Trim, who stood at the back of his chair:&mdash;No, an' please
your honour, replied the corporal.&mdash;But thou couldst discourse
about one, Trim, said my father, in case of need?&mdash;How is it
possible, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, if the corporal never saw
one?&mdash;'Tis the fact I want, replied my father,&mdash;and the
possibility of it is as follows.</p>
<p>A White Bear! Very well. Have I ever seen one? Might I ever have
seen one? Am I ever to see one? Ought I ever to have seen one? Or
can I ever see one?</p>
<p>Would I had seen a white bear! (for how can I imagine it?)</p>
<p>If I should see a white bear, what should I say? If I should
never see a white bear, what then?</p>
<p>If I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive;
have I ever seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one
painted?&mdash;described? Have I never dreamed of one?</p>
<p>Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever
see a white bear? What would they give? How would they behave? How
would the white bear have behaved? Is he wild? Tame? Terrible?
Rough? Smooth?</p>
<p>&mdash;Is the white bear worth seeing?&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Is there no sin in it?&mdash;</p>
<p>Is it better than a Black One?</p>

<p>When my father had danced his white bear backwards and forwards
through half a dozen pages, he closed the book for good an'
all,&mdash;and in a kind of triumph redelivered it into Trim's
hand, with a nod to lay it upon the 'scrutoire, where he found
it.&mdash;Tristram, said he, shall be made to conjugate every word
in the dictionary, backwards and forwards the same way;&mdash;every
word, Yorick, by this means, you see, is converted into a thesis or
an hypothesis;&mdash;every thesis and hypothesis have an off-spring
of propositions;&mdash;and each proposition has its own
consequences and conclusions; every one of which leads the mind on
again, into fresh tracks of enquiries and doubtings.&mdash;The
force of this engine, added my father, is incredible in opening a
child's head.&mdash;'Tis enough, brother Shandy, cried my uncle
Toby, to burst it into a thousand splinters.&mdash;</p>
<p>I presume, said Yorick, smiling,&mdash;it must be owing to
this,&mdash;(for let logicians say what they will, it is not to be
accounted for sufficiently from the bare use of the ten
predicaments)&mdash;That the famous Vincent Quirino, amongst the
many other astonishing feats of his childhood, of which the
Cardinal Bembo has given the world so exact a story,&mdash;should
be able to paste up in the public schools at Rome, so early as in
the eighth year of his age, no less than four thousand five hundred
and fifty different theses, upon the most abstruse points of the
most abstruse theology;&mdash;and to defend and maintain them in
such sort, as to cramp and dumbfound his opponents.&mdash;What is
that, cried my father, to what is told us of Alphonsus Tostatus,
who, almost in his nurse's arms, learned all the sciences and
liberal arts without being taught any one of them?&mdash;What shall
we say of the great Piereskius?&mdash;That's the very man, cried my
uncle Toby, I once told you of, brother Shandy, who walked a matter
of five hundred miles, reckoning from Paris to Shevling, and from
Shevling back again, merely to see Stevinus's flying
chariot.&mdash;He was a very great man! added my uncle Toby
(meaning Stevinus)&mdash;He was so, brother Toby, said my father
(meaning Piereskius)&mdash;and had multiplied his ideas so fast,
and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious stock, that, if we
may give credit to an anecdote concerning him, which we cannot
withhold here, without shaking the authority of all anecdotes
whatever&mdash;at seven years of age, his father committed entirely
to his care the education of his younger brother, a boy of five
years old,&mdash;with the sole management of all his
concerns.&mdash;Was the father as wise as the son? quoth my uncle
Toby:&mdash;I should think not, said Yorick:&mdash;But what are
these, continued my father&mdash;(breaking out in a kind of
enthusiasm)&mdash;what are these, to those prodigies of childhood
in Grotius, Scioppius, Heinsius, Politian, Pascal, Joseph Scaliger,
Ferdinand de Cordoue, and others&mdash;some of which left off their
substantial forms at nine years old, or sooner, and went on
reasoning without them;&mdash;others went through their classics at
seven;&mdash;wrote tragedies at eight;&mdash;Ferdinand de Cordoue
was so wise at nine,&mdash;'twas thought the Devil was in
him;&mdash;and at Venice gave such proofs of his knowledge and
goodness, that the monks imagined he was Antichrist, or
nothing.&mdash;Others were masters of fourteen languages at
ten,&mdash;finished the course of their rhetoric, poetry, logic,
and ethics, at eleven,&mdash;put forth their commentaries upon
Servius and Martianus Capella at twelve,&mdash;and at thirteen
received their degrees in philosophy, laws, and divinity:&mdash;but
you forget the great Lipsius, quoth Yorick, who composed a work
(Nous aurions quelque interet, says Baillet, de montrer qu'il n'a
rien de ridicule s'il etoit veritable, au moins dans le sens
enigmatique que Nicius Erythraeus a ta he de lui donner. Cet auteur
dit que pour comprendre comme Lipse, il a pu composer un ouvrage le

n'est pas celui de sa naissance charnelle, mais celui au quel il a
commence d'user de la raison; il veut que c'ait ete a l'age de neuf
ans; et il nous veut persuader que ce fut en cet age, que Lipse fit
un poeme.&mdash;Le tour est ingenieux, &amp;c. &amp;c.) the day he

distemper with anodynes,&mdash;and so a quarrel had ensued betwixt
them.</p>
<p>&mdash;Oh! oh!&mdash;said Slop, casting a glance of undue
freedom in Susannah's face, as she declined the office;&mdash;then,
I think I know you, madam&mdash;You know me, Sir! cried Susannah
fastidiously, and with a toss of her head, levelled evidently, not
at his profession, but at the doctor himself,&mdash;you know me!
cried Susannah again.&mdash;Doctor Slop clapped his finger and his
thumb instantly upon his nostrils;&mdash;Susannah's spleen was
ready to burst at it;&mdash;'Tis false, said Susannah.&mdash;Come,

candle;&mdash;A little this way, said Slop; Susannah looking one
way, and rowing another, instantly set fire to Slop's wig, which
being somewhat bushy and unctuous withal, was burnt out before it
was well kindled.&mdash;You impudent whore! cried Slop,&mdash;(for
what is passion, but a wild beast?)&mdash;you impudent whore, cried
Slop, getting upright, with the cataplasm in his hand;&mdash;I
never was the destruction of any body's nose, said

<h2>Chapter 3.XLVIII.</h2>
<p>You see 'tis high time, said my father, addressing himself
equally to my uncle Toby and Yorick, to take this young creature
out of these women's hands, and put him into those of a private
governor. Marcus Antoninus provided fourteen governors all at once
to superintend his son Commodus's education,&mdash;and in six weeks
he cashiered five of them;&mdash;I know very well, continued my
father, that Commodus's mother was in love with a gladiator at the
time of her conception, which accounts for a great many of
Commodus's cruelties when he became emperor;&mdash;but still I am
of opinion, that those five whom Antoninus dismissed, did
Commodus's temper, in that short time, more hurt than the other
nine were able to rectify all their lives long.</p>
<p>Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son, as the
mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night, by
which he is to adjust his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the
inmost sentiments of his heart;&mdash;I would have one, Yorick, if
possible, polished at all points, fit for my child to look
into.&mdash;This is very good sense, quoth my uncle Toby to
himself.</p>
<p>&mdash;There is, continued my father, a certain mien and motion
of the body and all its parts, both in acting and speaking, which
argues a man well within; and I am not at all surprised that
Gregory of Nazianzum, upon observing the hasty and untoward
gestures of Julian, should foretel he would one day become an
apostate;&mdash;or that St. Ambrose should turn his Amanuensis out
of doors, because of an indecent motion of his head, which went
backwards and forwards like a flail;&mdash;or that Democritus
should conceive Protagoras to be a scholar, from seeing him bind up
a faggot, and thrusting, as he did it, the small twigs
inwards.&mdash;There are a thousand unnoticed openings, continued
my father, which let a penetrating eye at once into a man's soul;
and I maintain it, added he, that a man of sense does not lay down
his hat in coming into a room,&mdash;or take it up in going out of
it, but something escapes, which discovers him.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons, continued my father, that the governor
I make choice of shall neither (Vid. Pellegrina.) lisp, or squint,
or wink, or talk loud, or look fierce, or foolish;&mdash;or bite
his lips, or grind his teeth, or speak through his nose, or pick
it, or blow it with his fingers.&mdash;He shall neither walk
fast,&mdash;or slow, or fold his arms,&mdash;for that is
laziness;&mdash;or hang them down,&mdash;for that is folly; or hide
them in his pocket, for that is nonsense.&mdash;</p>
<p>He shall neither strike, or pinch, or tickle&mdash;or bite, or
cut his nails, or hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his feet or
fingers in company;&mdash;nor (according to Erasmus) shall he speak
to any one in making water,&mdash;nor shall he point to carrion or
excrement.&mdash;Now this is all nonsense again, quoth my uncle
Toby to himself.&mdash;</p>
<p>I will have him, continued my father, cheerful, facete, jovial;
at the same time, prudent, attentive to business, vigilant, acute,
argute, inventive, quick in resolving doubts and speculative
questions;&mdash;he shall be wise, and judicious, and
learned:&mdash;And why not humble, and moderate, and
gentle-tempered, and good? said Yorick:&mdash;And why not, cried my
uncle Toby, free, and generous, and bountiful, and brave?&mdash;He
shall, my dear Toby, replied my father, getting up and shaking him
by his hand.&mdash;Then, brother Shandy, answered my uncle Toby,
raising himself off the chair, and laying down his pipe to take
hold of my father's other hand,&mdash;I humbly beg I may recommend
poor Le Fever's son to you;&mdash;a tear of joy of the first water
sparkled in my uncle Toby's eye, and another, the fellow to it, in
the corporal's, as the proposition was made;&mdash;you will see why
when you read Le Fever's story:&mdash;fool that I was! nor can I
recollect (nor perhaps you) without turning back to the place, what
it was that hindered me from letting the corporal tell it in his
own words;&mdash;but the occasion is lost,&mdash;I must tell it now

was taken by the allies,&mdash;which was about seven years before
my father came into the country,&mdash;and about as many, after the
time, that my uncle Toby and Trim had privately decamped from my
father's house in town, in order to lay some of the finest sieges
to some of the finest fortified cities in Europe&mdash;when my
uncle Toby was one evening getting his supper, with Trim sitting
behind him at a small sideboard,&mdash;I say, sitting&mdash;for in
consideration of the corporal's lame knee (which sometimes gave him
exquisite pain)&mdash;when my uncle Toby dined or supped alone, he
would never suffer the corporal to stand; and the poor fellow's
veneration for his master was such, that, with a proper artillery,
my uncle Toby could have taken Dendermond itself, with less trouble
than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time when
my uncle Toby supposed the corporal's leg was at rest, he would
look back, and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful
respect: this bred more little squabbles betwixt them, than all
other causes for five-and-twenty years together&mdash;But this is
neither here nor there&mdash;why do I mention it?&mdash;Ask my
pen,&mdash;it governs me,&mdash;I govern not it.</p>
<p>He was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord
of a little inn in the village came into the parlour, with an empty
phial in his hand, to beg a glass or two of sack; 'Tis for a poor
gentleman,&mdash;I think, of the army, said the landlord, who has
been taken ill at my house four days ago, and has never held up his
head since, or had a desire to taste any thing, till just now, that
he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast,&mdash;I think,
says he, taking his hand from his forehead, it would comfort
me.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such a
thing&mdash;added the landlord,&mdash;I would almost steal it for
the poor gentleman, he is so ill.&mdash;I hope in God he will still
mend, continued he,&mdash;we are all of us concerned for him.</p>
<p>Thou art a good-natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my
uncle Toby; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a
glass of sack thyself,&mdash;and take a couple of bottles with my
service, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a
dozen more if they will do him good.</p>
<p>Though I am persuaded, said my uncle Toby, as the landlord shut
the door, he is a very compassionate fellow&mdash;Trim,&mdash;yet I
cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too; there
must be something more than common in him, that in so short a time
should win so much upon the affections of his host;&mdash;And of
his whole family, added the corporal, for they are all concerned
for him,.&mdash;Step after him, said my uncle Toby,&mdash;do
Trim,&mdash;and ask if he knows his name.</p>
<p>&mdash;I have quite forgot it truly, said the landlord, coming
back into the parlour with the corporal,&mdash;but I can ask his
son again:&mdash;Has he a son with him then? said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve
years of age;&mdash;but the poor creature has tasted almost as
little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him
night and day:&mdash;He has not stirred from the bed-side these two
days.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate
from before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and Trim,
without being ordered, took away, without saying one word, and in a
few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</p>
<p>&mdash;Stay in the room a little, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>Trim!&mdash;said my uncle Toby, after he lighted his pipe, and
smoak'd about a dozen whiffs.&mdash;Trim came in front of his
master, and made his bow;&mdash;my uncle Toby smoak'd on, and said
no more.&mdash;Corporal! said my uncle Toby&mdash;the corporal made
his bow.&mdash;My uncle Toby proceeded no farther, but finished his
pipe.</p>
<p>Trim! said my uncle Toby, I have a project in my head, as it is
a bad night, of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure, and
paying a visit to this poor gentleman.&mdash;Your honour's
roquelaure, replied the corporal, has not once been had on, since
the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted
guard in the trenches before the gate of St. Nicholas;&mdash;and
besides, it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with the
roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give
your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your
groin. I fear so, replied my uncle Toby; but I am not at rest in my
mind, Trim, since the account the landlord has given me.&mdash;I
wish I had not known so much of this affair,&mdash;added my uncle
Toby,&mdash;or that I had known more of it:&mdash;How shall we
manage it? Leave it, an't please your honour, to me, quoth the
corporal;&mdash;I'll take my hat and stick and go to the house and
reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a
full account in an hour.&mdash;Thou shalt go, Trim, said my uncle
Toby, and here's a shilling for thee to drink with his
servant.&mdash;I shall get it all out of him, said the corporal,
shutting the door.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby filled his second pipe; and had it not been, that
he now and then wandered from the point, with considering whether
it was not full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a
straight line, as a crooked one,&mdash;he might be said to have
thought of nothing else but poor Le Fever and his boy the whole
time he smoaked it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.L.</h2>
<h3>The Story of Le Fever Continued.</h3>
<p>It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of his
third pipe, that corporal Trim returned from the inn, and gave him
the following account.</p>
<p>I despaired, at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick
lieutenant&mdash;Is he in the army, then? said my uncle
Toby&mdash;He is, said the corporal&mdash;And in what regiment?
said my uncle Toby&mdash;I'll tell your honour, replied the
corporal, every thing straight forwards, as I learnt
it.&mdash;Then, Trim, I'll fill another pipe, said my uncle Toby,
and not interrupt thee till thou hast done; so sit down at thy
ease, Trim, in the window-seat, and begin thy story again. The
corporal made his old bow, which generally spoke as plain as a bow
could speak it&mdash;Your honour is good:&mdash;And having done
that, he sat down, as he was ordered,&mdash;and begun the story to
my uncle Toby over again in pretty near the same words.</p>
<p>I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back any intelligence to your honour, about the lieutenant and his
son; for when I asked where his servant was, from whom I made
myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be
asked,&mdash;That's a right distinction, Trim, said my uncle
Toby&mdash;I was answered, an' please your honour, that he had no
servant with him;&mdash;that he had come to the inn with hired
horses, which, upon finding himself unable to proceed (to join, I
suppose, the regiment), he had dismissed the morning after he
came.&mdash;If I get better, my dear, said he, as he gave his purse
to his son to pay the man,&mdash;we can hire horses from
hence.&mdash;But alas! the poor gentleman will never get from
hence, said the landlady to me,&mdash;for I heard the death-watch
all night long;&mdash;and when he dies, the youth, his son, will
certainly die with him; for he is broken-hearted already.</p>
<p>I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the
youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toast the landlord
spoke of;&mdash;but I will do it for my father myself, said the
youth.&mdash;Pray let my save you the trouble, young gentleman,
said I, taking up a fork for the purpose, and offering him my chair
to sit down upon by the fire, whilst I did it.&mdash;I believe,
Sir, said he, very modestly, I can please him best myself.&mdash;I
am sure, said I, his honour will not like the toast the worse for
being toasted by an old soldier.&mdash;The youth took hold of my
hand, and instantly burst into tears.&mdash;Poor youth! said my
uncle Toby,&mdash;he has been bred up from an infant in the army,
and the name of a soldier, Trim, sounded in his ears like the name
of a friend;&mdash;I wish I had him here.</p>
<p>&mdash;I never, in the longest march, said the corporal, had so
great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for
company:&mdash;What could be the matter with me, an' please your
honour? Nothing in the world, Trim, said my uncle Toby, blowing his
nose,&mdash;but that thou art a good-natured fellow.</p>
<p>When I gave him the toast, continued the corporal, I thought it
was proper to tell him I was captain Shandy's servant, and that
your honour (though a stranger) was extremely concerned for his
father;&mdash;and that if there was any thing in your house or
cellar&mdash;(And thou might'st have added my purse too, said my
uncle Toby),&mdash;he was heartily welcome to it:&mdash;He made a
very low bow (which was meant to your honour), but no
answer&mdash;for his heart was full&mdash;so he went up stairs with
the toast;&mdash;I warrant you, my dear, said I, as I opened the
kitchen-door, your father will be well again.&mdash;Mr. Yorick's
curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire,&mdash;but said not a
word good or bad to comfort the youth.&mdash;I thought it wrong;
added the corporal&mdash;I think so too, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he
felt himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen, to
let me know, that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would
step up stairs.&mdash;I believe, said the landlord, he is going to
say his prayers,&mdash;for there was a book laid upon the chair by
his bed-side, and as I shut the door, I saw his son take up a
cushion.&mdash;</p>
<p>I thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr.
Trim, never said your prayers at all.&mdash;I heard the poor
gentleman say his prayers last night, said the landlady, very
devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed
it.&mdash;Are you sure of it? replied the curate.&mdash;A soldier,
an' please your reverence, said I, prays as often (of his own
accord) as a parson;&mdash;and when he is fighting for his king,
and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most
reason to pray to God of any one in the whole world&mdash;'Twas
well said of thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby.&mdash;But when a
soldier, said I, an' please your reverence, has been standing for
twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold
water,&mdash;or engaged, said I, for months together in long and
dangerous marches;&mdash;harassed, perhaps, in his rear
to-day;&mdash;harassing others to-morrow;&mdash;detached
here;&mdash;countermanded there;&mdash;resting this night out upon
his arms;&mdash;beat up in his shirt the next;&mdash;benumbed in
his joints;&mdash;perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel
on;&mdash;must say his prayers how and when he can.&mdash;I
believe, said I,&mdash;for I was piqued, quoth the corporal, for
the reputation of the army,&mdash;I believe, an' please your
reverence, said I, that when a soldier gets time to pray,&mdash;he
prays as heartily as a parson,&mdash;though not with all his fuss
and hypocrisy.&mdash;Thou shouldst not have said that, Trim, said
my uncle Toby,&mdash;for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who
is not:&mdash;At the great and general review of us all, corporal,
at the day of judgment (and not till then)&mdash;it will be seen
who has done their duties in this world,&mdash;and who has not; and
we shall be advanced, Trim, accordingly.&mdash;I hope we shall,
said Trim.&mdash;It is in the Scripture, said my uncle Toby; and I
will shew it thee to-morrow:&mdash;In the mean time we may depend
upon it, Trim, for our comfort, said my uncle Toby, that God
Almighty is so good and just a governor of the world, that if we
have but done our duties in it,&mdash;it will never be enquired
into, whether we have done them in a red coat or a black
one:&mdash;I hope not, said the corporal&mdash;But go on, Trim,
said my uncle Toby, with thy story.</p>
<p>When I went up, continued the corporal, into the lieutenant's
room, which I did not do till the expiration of the ten
minutes,&mdash;he was lying in his bed with his head raised upon
his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean white
cambrick handkerchief beside it:&mdash;The youth was just stooping
down to take up the cushion, upon which I supposed he had been
kneeling,&mdash;the book was laid upon the bed,&mdash;and, as he
rose, in taking up the cushion with one hand, he reached out his
other to take it away at the same time.&mdash;Let it remain there,
my dear, said the lieutenant.</p>
<p>He did not offer to speak to me, till I had walked up close to
his bed-side:&mdash;If you are captain Shandy's servant, said he,
you must present my thanks to your master, with my little boy's
thanks along with them, for his courtesy to me;&mdash;if he was of
Levens's&mdash;said the lieutenant.&mdash;I told him your honour
was&mdash;Then, said he, I served three campaigns with him in
Flanders, and remember him,&mdash;but 'tis most likely, as I had
not the honour of any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing
of me.&mdash;You will tell him, however, that the person his
good-nature has laid under obligations to him, is one Le Fever, a
lieutenant in Angus's&mdash;but he knows me not,&mdash;said he, a
second time, musing;&mdash;possibly he may my story&mdash;added
he&mdash;pray tell the captain, I was the ensign at Breda, whose
wife was most unfortunately killed with a musket-shot, as she lay
in my arms in my tent.&mdash;I remember the story, an't please your
honour, said I, very well.&mdash;Do you so? said he, wiping his
eyes with his handkerchief&mdash;then well may I.&mdash;In saying
this, he drew a little ring out of his bosom, which seemed tied
with a black ribband about his neck, and kiss'd it
twice&mdash;Here, Billy, said he,&mdash;the boy flew across the
room to the bed-side,&mdash;and falling down upon his knee, took
the ring in his hand, and kissed it too,&mdash;then kissed his
father, and sat down upon the bed and wept.</p>
<p>I wish, said my uncle Toby, with a deep sigh,&mdash;I wish,
Trim, I was asleep.</p>
<p>Your honour, replied the corporal, is too much
concerned;&mdash;shall I pour your honour out a glass of sack to
your pipe?&mdash;Do, Trim, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>I remember, said my uncle Toby, sighing again, the story of the
ensign and his wife, with a circumstance his modesty
omitted;&mdash;and particularly well that he, as well as she, upon
some account or other (I forget what) was universally pitied by the
whole regiment;&mdash;but finish the story thou art
upon:&mdash;'Tis finished already, said the corporal,&mdash;for I
could stay no longer,&mdash;so wished his honour a good night;
young Le Fever rose from off the bed, and saw me to the bottom of
the stairs; and as we went down together, told me, they had come
from Ireland, and were on their route to join the regiment in
Flanders.&mdash;But alas! said the corporal,&mdash;the lieutenant's
last day's march is over.&mdash;Then what is to become of his poor
boy? cried my uncle Toby.</p>

<h3>The Story of Le Fever Continued.</h3>
<p>It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honour,&mdash;though I tell it
only for the sake of those, who, when coop'd in betwixt a natural
and a positive law, know not, for their souls, which way in the
world to turn themselves&mdash;That notwithstanding my uncle Toby
was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of
Dendermond, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on so
vigorously, that they scarce allowed him time to get his
dinner&mdash;that nevertheless he gave up Dendermond, though he had
already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp;&mdash;and bent his
whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn; and
except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by which he
might be said to have turned the siege of Dendermond into a
blockade,&mdash;he left Dendermond to itself&mdash;to be relieved
or not by the French king, as the French king thought good; and
only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant
and his son.</p>
<p>&mdash;That kind Being, who is a friend to the friendless, shall
recompence thee for this.</p>
<p>Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle Toby to the
corporal, as he was putting him to bed,&mdash;and I will tell thee
in what, Trim.&mdash;In the first place, when thou madest an offer
of my services to Le Fever,&mdash;as sickness and travelling are
both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant, with
a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay,&mdash;that thou
didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood
in need, thou knowest, Trim, he had been as welcome to it as
myself.&mdash;Your honour knows, said the corporal, I had no
orders;&mdash;True, quoth my uncle Toby,&mdash;thou didst very
right, Trim, as a soldier,&mdash;but certainly very wrong as a
man.</p>
<p>In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same
excuse, continued my uncle Toby,&mdash;when thou offeredst him
whatever was in my house,&mdash;thou shouldst have offered him my
house too:&mdash;A sick brother officer should have the best
quarters, Trim, and if we had him with us,&mdash;we could tend and
look to him:&mdash;Thou art an excellent nurse thyself,
Trim,&mdash;and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's and
his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once,
and set him upon his legs.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby,
smiling,&mdash;he might march.&mdash;He will never march; an'
please your honour, in this world, said the corporal:&mdash;He will
march; said my uncle Toby, rising up from the side of the bed, with
one shoe off:&mdash;An' please your honour, said the corporal, he
will never march but to his grave:&mdash;He shall march, cried my
uncle Toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without
advanceing an inch,&mdash;he shall march to his regiment.&mdash;He
cannot stand it, said the corporal;&mdash;He shall be supported,
said my uncle Toby;&mdash;He'll drop at last, said the corporal,
and what will become of his boy?&mdash;He shall not drop, said my
uncle Toby, firmly.&mdash;A-well-o'day,&mdash;do what we can for
him, said Trim, maintaining his point,&mdash;the poor soul will
die:&mdash;He shall not die, by G.., cried my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Accusing Spirit, which flew up to heaven's chancery
with the oath, blush'd as he gave it in;&mdash;and the Recording
Angel, as he wrote it down, dropp'd a tear upon the word, and
blotted it out for ever.</p>

<h3>The Story of Le Fever Continued.</h3>
<p>The sun looked bright the morning after, to every eye in the
village but Le Fever's and his afflicted son's; the hand of death
pressed heavy upon his eye-lids,&mdash;and hardly could the wheel
at the cistern turn round its circle,&mdash;when my uncle Toby, who
had rose up an hour before his wonted time, entered the
lieutenant's room, and without preface or apology, sat himself down
upon the chair by the bed-side, and, independently of all modes and
customs, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother
officer would have done it, and asked him how he did,&mdash;how he
had rested in the night,&mdash;what was his complaint,&mdash;where
was his pain,&mdash;and what he could do to help him:&mdash;and
without giving him time to answer any one of the enquiries, went
on, and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting
with the corporal the night before for him.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;You shall go home directly, Le Fever, said my uncle Toby,
to my house,&mdash;and we'll send for a doctor to see what's the
matter,&mdash;and we'll have an apothecary,&mdash;and the corporal
shall be your nurse;&mdash;and I'll be your servant, Le Fever.</p>
<p>There was a frankness in my uncle Toby,&mdash;not the effect of
familiarity,&mdash;but the cause of it,&mdash;which let you at once
into his soul, and shewed you the goodness of his nature; to this
there was something in his looks, and voice, and manner,
superadded, which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and
take shelter under him, so that before my uncle Toby had half
finished the kind offers he was making to the father, had the son
insensibly pressed up close to his knees, and had taken hold of the
breast of his coat, and was pulling it towards him.&mdash;The blood
and spirits of Le Fever, which were waxing cold and slow within
him, and were retreating to their last citadel, the
heart&mdash;rallied back,&mdash;the film forsook his eyes for a
moment,&mdash;he looked up wishfully in my uncle Toby's
face,&mdash;then cast a look upon his boy,&mdash;and that ligament,
fine as it was,&mdash;was never broken.&mdash;</p>
<p>Nature instantly ebb'd again,&mdash;the film returned to its
place,&mdash;the pulse fluttered&mdash;stopp'd&mdash;went
on&mdash;throbb'd&mdash;stopp'd
again&mdash;moved&mdash;stopp'd&mdash;shall I go on?&mdash;No.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LIV.</h2>
<p>I am so impatient to return to my own story, that what remains
of young Le Fever's, that is, from this turn of his fortune, to the
time my uncle Toby recommended him for my preceptor, shall be told
in a very few words in the next chapter.&mdash;All that is
necessary to be added to this chapter is as follows.&mdash;</p>
<p>That my uncle Toby, with young Le Fever in his hand, attended
the poor lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.</p>
<p>That the governor of Dendermond paid his obsequies all military
honours,&mdash;and that Yorick, not to be behind-hand&mdash;paid
him all ecclesiastic&mdash;for he buried him in his
chancel:&mdash;And it appears likewise, he preached a funeral
sermon over him&mdash;I say it appears,&mdash;for it was Yorick's
custom, which I suppose a general one with those of his profession,
on the first leaf of every sermon which he composed, to chronicle
down the time, the place, and the occasion of its being preached:
to this, he was ever wont to add some short comment or stricture
upon the sermon itself, seldom, indeed, much to its
credit:&mdash;For instance, This sermon upon the Jewish
dispensation&mdash;I don't like it at all;&mdash;Though I own there
is a world of Water-Landish knowledge in it;&mdash;but 'tis all
tritical, and most tritically put together.&mdash;This is but a
flimsy kind of a composition; what was in my head when I made
it?</p>
<p>&mdash;N.B. The excellency of this text is, that it will suit
any sermon,&mdash;and of this sermon,&mdash;that it will suit any
text.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;For this sermon I shall be hanged,&mdash;for I have
stolen the greatest part of it. Doctor Paidagunes found me out.
&gt; Set a thief to catch a thief.&mdash;</p>
<p>On the back of half a dozen I find written, So, so, and no
more&mdash;and upon a couple Moderato; by which, as far as one may
gather from Altieri's Italian dictionary,&mdash;but mostly from the
authority of a piece of green whipcord, which seemed to have been
the unravelling of Yorick's whip-lash, with which he has left us
the two sermons marked Moderato, and the half dozen of So, so, tied
fast together in one bundle by themselves,&mdash;one may safely
suppose he meant pretty near the same thing.</p>
<p>There is but one difficulty in the way of this conjecture, which
is this, that the moderato's are five times better than the so,
so's;&mdash;show ten times more knowledge of the human
heart;&mdash;have seventy times more wit and spirit in
them;&mdash;(and, to rise properly in my climax)&mdash;discovered a
thousand times more genius;&mdash;and to crown all, are infinitely
more entertaining than those tied up with them:&mdash;for which
reason, whene'er Yorick's dramatic sermons are offered to the
world, though I shall admit but one out of the whole number of the
so, so's, I shall, nevertheless, adventure to print the two
moderato's without any sort of scruple.</p>
<p>What Yorick could mean by the words
lentamente,&mdash;tenute,&mdash;grave,&mdash;and sometimes
adagio,&mdash;as applied to theological compositions, and with
which he has characterised some of these sermons, I dare not
venture to guess.&mdash;I am more puzzled still upon finding a
l'octava alta! upon one;&mdash;Con strepito upon the back of
another;&mdash;Scicilliana upon a third;&mdash;Alla capella upon a
fourth;&mdash;Con l'arco upon this;&mdash;Senza l'arco upon
that.&mdash;All I know is, that they are musical terms, and have a
meaning;&mdash;and as he was a musical man, I will make no doubt,
but that by some quaint application of such metaphors to the
compositions in hand, they impressed very distinct ideas of their
several characters upon his fancy,&mdash;whatever they may do upon
that of others.</p>
<p>Amongst these, there is that particular sermon which has
unaccountably led me into this digression&mdash;The funeral sermon
upon poor Le Fever, wrote out very fairly, as if from a hasty
copy.&mdash;I take notice of it the more, because it seems to have
been his favourite composition&mdash;It is upon mortality; and is
tied length-ways and cross-ways with a yarn thrum, and then rolled
up and twisted round with a half-sheet of dirty blue paper, which
seems to have been once the cast cover of a general review, which
to this day smells horribly of horse drugs.&mdash;Whether these
marks of humiliation were designed,&mdash;I something
doubt;&mdash;because at the end of the sermon (and not at the
beginning of it)&mdash;very different from his way of treating the
rest, he had wrote&mdash;Bravo!</p>
<p>&mdash;Though not very offensively,&mdash;for it is at two
inches, at least, and a half's distance from, and below the
concluding line of the sermon, at the very extremity of the page,
and in that right hand corner of it, which, you know, is generally
covered with your thumb; and, to do it justice, it is wrote besides
with a crow's quill so faintly in a small Italian hand, as scarce
to solicit the eye towards the place, whether your thumb is there
or not,&mdash;so that from the manner of it, it stands half
excused; and being wrote moreover with very pale ink, diluted
almost to nothing,&mdash;'tis more like a ritratto of the shadow of
vanity, than of Vanity herself&mdash;of the two; resembling rather
a faint thought of transient applause, secretly stirring up in the
heart of the composer; than a gross mark of it, coarsely obtruded
upon the world.</p>
<p>With all these extenuations, I am aware, that in publishing
this, I do no service to Yorick's character as a modest
man;&mdash;but all men have their failings! and what lessens this
still farther, and almost wipes it away, is this; that the word was
struck through sometime afterwards (as appears from a different
tint of the ink) with a line quite across it in this manner, BRAVO
(crossed out)&mdash;as if he had retracted, or was ashamed of the
opinion he had once entertained of it.</p>
<p>These short characters of his sermons were always written,
excepting in this one instance, upon the first leaf of his sermon,
which served as a cover to it; and usually upon the inside of it,
which was turned towards the text;&mdash;but at the end of his
discourse, where, perhaps, he had five or six pages, and sometimes,
perhaps, a whole score to turn himself in,&mdash;he took a large
circuit, and, indeed, a much more mettlesome one;&mdash;as if he
had snatched the occasion of unlacing himself with a few more
frolicksome strokes at vice, than the straitness of the pulpit
allowed.&mdash;These, though hussar-like, they skirmish lightly and
out of all order, are still auxiliaries on the side of
virtue;&mdash;tell me then, Mynheer Vander
Blonederdondergewdenstronke, why they should not be printed
together?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LV.</h2>
<p>When my uncle Toby had turned every thing into money, and
settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and Le
Fever, and betwixt Le Fever and all mankind,&mdash;there remained
nothing more in my uncle Toby's hands, than an old regimental coat
and a sword; so that my uncle Toby found little or no opposition
from the world in taking administration. The coat my uncle Toby
gave the corporal;&mdash;Wear it, Trim, said my uncle Toby, as long
as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor
lieutenant&mdash;And this,&mdash;said my uncle Toby, taking up the
sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he
spoke&mdash;and this, Le Fever, I'll save for thee,&mdash;'tis all
the fortune, continued my uncle Toby, hanging it up upon a crook,
and pointing to it,&mdash;'tis all the fortune, my dear Le Fever,
which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight
thy way with it in the world,&mdash;and thou doest it like a man of
honour,&mdash;'tis enough for us.</p>
<p>As soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation, and taught him
to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public
school, where, excepting Whitsontide and Christmas, at which times
the corporal was punctually dispatched for him,&mdash;he remained
to the spring of the year, seventeen; when the stories of the
emperor's sending his army into Hungary against the Turks, kindling
a spark of fire in his bosom, he left his Greek and Latin without
leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle Toby,
begged his father's sword, and my uncle Toby's leave along with it,
to go and try his fortune under Eugene.&mdash;Twice did my uncle
Toby forget his wound and cry out, Le Fever! I will go with thee,
and thou shalt fight beside me&mdash;And twice he laid his hand
upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and
disconsolation.&mdash;</p>
<p>My uncle Toby took down the sword from the crook, where it had
hung untouched ever since the lieutenant's death, and delivered it
to the corporal to brighten up;&mdash;and having detained Le Fever
a single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to
Leghorn,&mdash;he put the sword into his hand.&mdash;If thou art
brave, Le Fever, said my uncle Toby, this will not fail
thee,&mdash;but Fortune, said he (musing a little),&mdash;Fortune
may&mdash;And if she does,&mdash;added my uncle Toby, embracing
him, come back again to me, Le Fever, and we will shape thee
another course.</p>
<p>The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of Le
Fever more than my uncle Toby's paternal kindness;&mdash;he parted
from my uncle Toby, as the best of sons from the best of
fathers&mdash;both dropped tears&mdash;and as my uncle Toby gave
him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old
purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his
hand,&mdash;and bid God bless him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LVI.</h2>
<p>Le Fever got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try
what metal his sword was made of, at the defeat of the Turks before
Belgrade; but a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from
that moment, and trod close upon his heels for four years together
after; he had withstood these buffetings to the last, till sickness
overtook him at Marseilles, from whence he wrote my uncle Toby
word, he had lost his time, his services, his health, and, in
short, every thing but his sword;&mdash;and was waiting for the
first ship to return back to him.</p>
<p>As this letter came to hand about six weeks before Susannah's
accident, Le Fever was hourly expected; and was uppermost in my
uncle Toby's mind all the time my father was giving him and Yorick
a description of what kind of a person he would chuse for a
preceptor to me: but as my uncle Toby thought my father at first
somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he required, he forbore
mentioning Le Fever's name,&mdash;till the character, by Yorick's
inter-position, ending unexpectedly, in one, who should be
gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed the image of
Le Fever, and his interest, upon my uncle Toby so forcibly, he rose
instantly off his chair; and laying down his pipe, in order to take
hold of both my father's hands&mdash;I beg, brother Shandy, said my
uncle Toby, I may recommend poor Le Fever's son to you&mdash;I
beseech you do, added Yorick&mdash;He has a good heart, said my
uncle Toby&mdash;And a brave one too, an' please your honour, said
the corporal.</p>
<p>&mdash;The best hearts, Trim, are ever the bravest, replied my
uncle Toby.&mdash;And the greatest cowards, an' please your honour,
in our regiment, were the greatest rascals in it.&mdash;There was
serjeant Kumber, and ensign&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;We'll talk of them, said my father, another time.</p>

<p>What a jovial and a merry world would this be, may it please
your worships, but for that inextricable labyrinth of debts, cares,
woes, want, grief, discontent, melancholy, large jointures,
impositions, and lies!</p>
<p>Doctor Slop, like a son of a w..., as my father called him for
it,&mdash;to exalt himself,&mdash;debased me to death,&mdash;and
made ten thousand times more of Susannah's accident, than there was
any grounds for; so that in a week's time, or less, it was in every
body's mouth, That poor Master Shandy...entirely.&mdash;And Fame,
who loves to double every thing,&mdash;in three days more, had
sworn, positively she saw it,&mdash;and all the world, as usual,
gave credit to her evidence&mdash;'That the nursery window had not

<p>Could the world have been sued like a Body-Corporate,&mdash;my
father had brought an action upon the case, and trounced it
sufficiently; but to fall foul of individuals about it&mdash;as
every soul who had mentioned the affair, did it with the greatest
pity imaginable;&mdash;'twas like flying in the very face of his
best friends:&mdash;And yet to acquiesce under the report, in
silence&mdash;was to acknowledge it openly,&mdash;at least in the
opinion of one half of the world; and to make a bustle again, in
contradicting it,&mdash;was to confirm it as strongly in the
opinion of the other half.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered?
said my father.</p>

cross.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LIX.</h2>
<p>There are a thousand resolutions, Sir, both in church and state,
as well as in matters, Madam, of a more private
concern;&mdash;which, though they have carried all the appearance
in the world of being taken, and entered upon in a hasty,
hare-brained, and unadvised manner, were, notwithstanding this,
(and could you or I have got into the cabinet, or stood behind the

perpended&mdash;argued upon&mdash;canvassed through&mdash;entered

Goddess of Coolness herself (I do not take upon me to prove her
existence) could neither have wished it, or done it better.</p>
<p>Of the number of these was my father's resolution of putting me
into breeches; which, though determined at once,&mdash;in a kind of
huff, and a defiance of all mankind, had, nevertheless, been pro'd
and conn'd, and judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother
about a month before, in two several beds of justice, which my
father had held for that purpose. I shall explain the nature of
these beds of justice in my next chapter; and in the chapter
following that, you shall step with me, Madam, behind the curtain,
only to hear in what kind of manner my father and my mother debated
between themselves, this affair of the breeches,&mdash;from which
you may form an idea, how they debated all lesser matters.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LX.</h2>
<p>The ancient Goths of Germany, who (the learned Cluverius is
positive) were first seated in the country between the Vistula and
the Oder, and who afterwards incorporated the Herculi, the Bugians,
and some other Vandallick clans to 'em&mdash;had all of them a wise
custom of debating every thing of importance to their state, twice,
that is,&mdash;once drunk, and once sober:&mdash;Drunk&mdash;that
their councils might not want vigour;&mdash;and sober&mdash;that
they might not want discretion.</p>
<p>Now my father being entirely a water-drinker,&mdash;was a long
time gravelled almost to death, in turning this as much to his
advantage, as he did every other thing which the ancients did or
said; and it was not till the seventh year of his marriage, after a
thousand fruitless experiments and devices, that he hit upon an
expedient which answered the purpose;&mdash;and that was, when any
difficult and momentous point was to be settled in the family,
which required great sobriety, and great spirit too, in its
determination,&mdash;he fixed and set apart the first Sunday night
in the month, and the Saturday night which immediately preceded it,
to argue it over, in bed with my mother: By which contrivance, if
you consider, Sir, with yourself,.. ..</p>
<p>These my father, humorously enough, called his beds of
justice;&mdash;for from the two different counsels taken in these
two different humours, a middle one was generally found out which
touched the point of wisdom as well, as if he had got drunk and
sober a hundred times.</p>
<p>I must not be made a secret of to the world, that this answers
full as well in literary discussions, as either in military or
conjugal; but it is not every author that can try the experiment as
the Goths and Vandals did it&mdash;or, if he can, may it be always
for his body's health; and to do it, as my father did it,&mdash;am
I sure it would be always for his soul's.</p>
<p>My way is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>In all nice and ticklish discussions,&mdash;(of which, heaven
knows, there are but too many in my book)&mdash;where I find I
cannot take a step without the danger of having either their
worships or their reverences upon my back&mdash;I write one-half
full,&mdash;and t'other fasting;&mdash;or write it all
full,&mdash;and correct it fasting;&mdash;or write it
fasting,&mdash;and correct it full, for they all come to the same
thing:&mdash;So that with a less variation from my father's plan,
than my father's from the Gothick&mdash;I feel myself upon a par
with him in his first bed of justice,&mdash;and no way inferior to
him in his second.&mdash;These different and almost irreconcileable
effects, flow uniformly from the wise and wonderful mechanism of
nature,&mdash;of which,&mdash;be her's the honour.&mdash;All that
we can do, is to turn and work the machine to the improvement and
better manufactory of the arts and sciences.&mdash;</p>
<p>Now, when I write full,&mdash;I write as if I was never to write
fasting again as long as I live;&mdash;that is, I write free from
the cares as well as the terrors of the world.&mdash;I count not
the number of my scars,&mdash;nor does my fancy go forth into dark
entries and bye-corners to ante-date my stabs.&mdash;In a word, my
pen takes its course; and I write on as much from the fulness of my
heart, as my stomach.&mdash;</p>
<p>But when, an' please your honours, I indite fasting, 'tis a
different history.&mdash;I pay the world all possible attention and
respect,&mdash;and have as great a share (whilst it lasts) of that
under strapping virtue of discretion as the best of you.&mdash;So
that betwixt both, I write a careless kind of a civil, nonsensical,
good-humoured Shandean book, which will do all your hearts
good&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And all your heads too,&mdash;provided you understand
it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXI.</h2>
<p>We should begin, said my father, turning himself half round in
bed, and shifting his pillow a little towards my mother's, as he
opened the debate&mdash;We should begin to think, Mrs. Shandy, of
putting this boy into breeches.&mdash;</p>
<p>We should so,&mdash;said my mother.&mdash;We defer it, my dear,
quoth my father, shamefully.&mdash;</p>
<p>I think we do, Mr. Shandy,&mdash;said my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;Not but the child looks extremely well, said my father,
in his vests and tunicks.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;He does look very well in them,&mdash;replied my
mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And for that reason it would be almost a sin, added my
father, to take him out of 'em.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It would so,&mdash;said my mother:&mdash;But indeed he is
growing a very tall lad,&mdash;rejoined my father.</p>
<p>&mdash;He is very tall for his age, indeed,&mdash;said my
mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I can not (making two syllables of it) imagine, quoth my
father, who the deuce he takes after.&mdash;</p>
<p>I cannot conceive, for my life, said my mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>Humph!&mdash;said my father.</p>
<p>(The dialogue ceased for a moment.)</p>
<p>&mdash;I am very short myself,&mdash;continued my father
gravely.</p>
<p>You are very short, Mr. Shandy,&mdash;said my mother.</p>
<p>Humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering
which, he plucked his pillow a little further from my
mother's,&mdash;and turning about again, there was an end of the
debate for three minutes and a half.</p>
<p>&mdash;When he gets these breeches made, cried my father in a
higher tone, he'll look like a beast in 'em.</p>
<p>He will be very awkward in them at first, replied my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;And 'twill be lucky, if that's the worst on't, added my
father.</p>
<p>It will be very lucky, answered my mother.</p>
<p>I suppose, replied my father,&mdash;making some pause
first,&mdash;he'll be exactly like other people's
children.&mdash;</p>
<p>Exactly, said my mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Though I shall be sorry for that, added my father: and so
the debate stopp'd again.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;They should be of leather, said my father, turning him
about again.&mdash;</p>
<p>They will last him, said my mother, the longest.</p>
<p>But he can have no linings to 'em, replied my father.&mdash;</p>
<p>He cannot, said my mother.</p>
<p>'Twere better to have them of fustian, quoth my father.</p>
<p>Nothing can be better, quoth my mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Except dimity,&mdash;replied my father:&mdash;'Tis best
of all,&mdash;replied my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;One must not give him his death,
however,&mdash;interrupted my father.</p>
<p>By no means, said my mother:&mdash;and so the dialogue stood
still again.</p>
<p>I am resolved, however, quoth my father, breaking silence the
fourth time, he shall have no pockets in them.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;There is no occasion for any, said my mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>I mean in his coat and waistcoat,&mdash;cried my father.</p>
<p>&mdash;I mean so too,&mdash;replied my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;Though if he gets a gig or top&mdash;Poor souls! it is a
crown and a sceptre to them,&mdash;they should have where to secure
it.&mdash;</p>
<p>Order it as you please, Mr. Shandy, replied my
mother.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But don't you think it right? added my father, pressing
the point home to her.</p>
<p>Perfectly, said my mother, if it pleases you, Mr.
Shandy.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;There's for you! cried my father, losing his
temper&mdash;Pleases me!&mdash;You never will distinguish, Mrs.
Shandy, nor shall I ever teach you to do it, betwixt a point of
pleasure and a point of convenience.&mdash;This was on the Sunday
night:&mdash;and further this chapter sayeth not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXII.</h2>
<p>After my father had debated the affair of the breeches with my
mother,&mdash;he consulted Albertus Rubenius upon it; and Albertus
Rubenius used my father ten times worse in the consultation (if
possible) than even my father had used my mother: For as Rubenius
had wrote a quarto express, De re Vestiaria Veterum,&mdash;it was
Rubenius's business to have given my father some lights.&mdash;On
the contrary, my father might as well have thought of extracting
the seven cardinal virtues out of a long beard,&mdash;as of
extracting a single word out of Rubenius upon the subject.</p>
<p>Upon every other article of ancient dress, Rubenius was very
communicative to my father;&mdash;gave him a full satisfactory
account of</p>
<pre>
 The Toga, or loose gown.
 The Chlamys.
 The Ephod.
 The Tunica, or Jacket.
 The Synthesis.
 The Paenula.
 The Lacema, with its Cucullus.
 The Paludamentum.
 The Praetexta.
 The Sagum, or soldier's jerkin.
 The Trabea: of which, according to Suetonius, there was three kinds.&mdash;
</pre>
<p>&mdash;But what are all these to the breeches? said my
father.</p>
<p>Rubenius threw him down upon the counter all kinds of shoes
which had been in fashion with the Romans.&mdash;</p>
<pre>
 There was,
 The open shoe.
 The close shoe.
 The slip shoe.
 The wooden shoe.
 The soc.
 The buskin.
 And The military shoe with hobnails in it, which Juvenal takes
    notice of.

 There were,
 The clogs.
 The pattins.
 The pantoufles.
 The brogues.
 The sandals, with latchets to them.

 There was,
 The felt shoe.
 The linen shoe.
 The laced shoe.
 The braided shoe.
 The calceus incisus.
 And The calceus rostratus.
</pre>
<p>Rubenius shewed my father how well they all fitted,&mdash;in
what manner they laced on,&mdash;with what points, straps, thongs,
latchets, ribbands, jaggs, and ends.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But I want to be informed about the breeches, said my
father.</p>
<p>Albertus Rubenius informed my father that the Romans
manufactured stuffs of various fabrics,&mdash;some
plain,&mdash;some striped,&mdash;others diapered throughout the
whole contexture of the wool, with silk and gold&mdash;That linen
did not begin to be in common use till towards the declension of
the empire, when the Egyptians coming to settle amongst them,
brought it into vogue.</p>
<p>&mdash;That persons of quality and fortune distinguished
themselves by the fineness and whiteness of their clothes; which
colour (next to purple, which was appropriated to the great
offices) they most affected, and wore on their birth-days and
public rejoicings.&mdash;That it appeared from the best historians
of those times, that they frequently sent their clothes to the
fuller, to be clean'd and whitened:&mdash;but that the inferior
people, to avoid that expence, generally wore brown clothes, and of
a something coarser texture,&mdash;till towards the beginning of
Augustus's reign, when the slave dressed like his master, and
almost every distinction of habiliment was lost, but the Latus
Clavus.</p>
<p>And what was the Latus Clavus? said my father.</p>
<p>Rubenius told him, that the point was still litigating amongst
the learned:&mdash;That Egnatius, Sigonius, Bossius Ticinensis,
Bayfius Budaeus, Salmasius, Lipsius, Lazius, Isaac Casaubon, and
Joseph Scaliger, all differed from each other,&mdash;and he from
them: That some took it to be the button,&mdash;some the coat
itself,&mdash;others only the colour of it;&mdash;That the great
Bayfuis in his Wardrobe of the Ancients, chap. 12&mdash;honestly
said, he knew not what it was,&mdash;whether a tibula,&mdash;a
stud,&mdash;a button,&mdash;a loop,&mdash;a buckle,&mdash;or clasps
and keepers.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;My father lost the horse, but not the saddle&mdash;They
are hooks and eyes, said my father&mdash;and with hooks and eyes he
ordered my breeches to be made.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXIV.</h2>
<p>If the reader has not a clear conception of the rood and the
half of ground which lay at the bottom of my uncle Toby's
kitchen-garden, and which was the scene of so many of his delicious
hours,&mdash;the fault is not in me,&mdash;but in his
imagination;&mdash;for I am sure I gave him so minute a
description, I was almost ashamed of it.</p>
<p>When Fate was looking forwards one afternoon, into the great
transactions of future times,&mdash;and recollected for what
purposes this little plot, by a decree fast bound down in iron, had
been destined,&mdash;she gave a nod to Nature,&mdash;'twas
enough&mdash;Nature threw half a spade full of her kindliest
compost upon it, with just so much clay in it, as to retain the
forms of angles and indentings,&mdash;and so little of it too, as
not to cling to the spade, and render works of so much glory, nasty
in foul weather.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby came down, as the reader has been informed, with
plans along with him, of almost every fortified town in Italy and
Flanders; so let the duke of Marlborough, or the allies, have set
down before what town they pleased, my uncle Toby was prepared for
them.</p>
<p>His way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as
soon as ever a town was invested&mdash;(but sooner when the design
was known) to take the plan of it (let it be what town it would),
and enlarge it upon a scale to the exact size of his bowling-green;
upon the surface of which, by means of a large role of packthread,
and a number of small piquets driven into the ground, at the
several angles and redans, he transferred the lines from his paper;
then taking the profile of the place, with its works, to determine
the depths and slopes of the ditches,&mdash;the talus of the
glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets,
&amp;c.&mdash;he set the corporal to work&mdash;and sweetly went it
on:&mdash;The nature of the soil,&mdash;the nature of the work
itself,&mdash;and above all, the good-nature of my uncle Toby
sitting by from morning to night, and chatting kindly with the
corporal upon past-done deeds,&mdash;left Labour little else but
the ceremony of the name.</p>
<p>When the place was finished in this manner, and put into a
proper posture of defence,&mdash;it was invested,&mdash;and my
uncle Toby and the corporal began to run their first
parallel.&mdash;I beg I may not be interrupted in my story, by
being told, That the first parallel should be at least three
hundred toises distant from the main body of the place,&mdash;and
that I have not left a single inch for it;&mdash;for my uncle Toby
took the liberty of incroaching upon his kitchen-garden, for the
sake of enlarging his works on the bowling-green, and for that
reason generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt two
rows of his cabbages and his cauliflowers; the conveniences and
inconveniences of which will be considered at large in the history
of my uncle Toby's and the corporal's campaigns, of which, this I'm
now writing is but a sketch, and will be finished, if I conjecture
right, in three pages (but there is no guessing)&mdash;The
campaigns themselves will take up as many books; and therefore I
apprehend it would be hanging too great a weight of one kind of
matter in so flimsy a performance as this, to rhapsodize them, as I
once intended, into the body of the work&mdash;surely they had
better be printed apart,&mdash;we'll consider the affair&mdash;so
take the following sketch of them in the mean time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXV.</h2>
<p>When the town, with its works, was finished, my uncle Toby and
the corporal began to run their first parallel&mdash;not at random,
or any how&mdash;but from the same points and distances the allies
had begun to run theirs; and regulating their approaches and
attacks, by the accounts my uncle Toby received from the daily
papers,&mdash;they went on, during the whole siege, step by step
with the allies.</p>
<p>When the duke of Marlborough made a lodgment,&mdash;my uncle
Toby made a lodgment too.&mdash;And when the face of a bastion was
battered down, or a defence ruined,&mdash;the corporal took his
mattock and did as much,&mdash;and so on;&mdash;gaining ground, and
making themselves masters of the works one after another, till the
town fell into their hands.</p>
<p>To one who took pleasure in the happy state of
others,&mdash;there could not have been a greater sight in world,
than on a post morning, in which a practicable breach had been made
by the duke of Marlborough, in the main body of the place,&mdash;to
have stood behind the horn-beam hedge, and observed the spirit with
which my uncle Toby, with Trim behind him, sallied forth;&mdash;the
one with the Gazette in his hand,&mdash;the other with a spade on
his shoulder to execute the contents.&mdash;What an honest triumph
in my uncle Toby's looks as he marched up to the ramparts! What
intense pleasure swimming in his eye as he stood over the corporal,
reading the paragraph ten times over to him, as he was at work,
lest, peradventure, he should make the breach an inch too
wide,&mdash;or leave it an inch too narrow.&mdash;But when the
chamade was beat, and the corporal helped my uncle up it, and
followed with the colours in his hand, to fix them upon the
ramparts&mdash;Heaven! Earth! Sea!&mdash;but what avails
apostrophes?&mdash;with all your elements, wet or dry, ye never
compounded so intoxicating a draught.</p>
<p>In this track of happiness for many years, without one
interruption to it, except now and then when the wind continued to
blow due west for a week or ten days together, which detained the
Flanders mail, and kept them so long in torture,&mdash;but still
'twas the torture of the happy&mdash;In this track, I say, did my
uncle Toby and Trim move for many years, every year of which, and
sometimes every month, from the invention of either the one or the
other of them, adding some new conceit or quirk of improvement to
their operations, which always opened fresh springs of delight in
carrying them on.</p>
<p>The first year's campaign was carried on from beginning to end,
in the plain and simple method I've related.</p>
<p>In the second year, in which my uncle Toby took Liege and
Ruremond, he thought he might afford the expence of four handsome
draw-bridges; of two of which I have given an exact description in
the former part of my work.</p>
<p>At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates
with port-cullises:&mdash;These last were converted afterwards into
orgues, as the better thing; and during the winter of the same
year, my uncle Toby, instead of a new suit of clothes, which he
always had at Christmas, treated himself with a handsome
sentry-box, to stand at the corner of the bowling-green, betwixt
which point and the foot of the glacis, there was left a little
kind of an esplanade for him and the corporal to confer and hold
councils of war upon.</p>
<p>&mdash;The sentry-box was in case of rain.</p>
<p>All these were painted white three times over the ensuing
spring, which enabled my uncle Toby to take the field with great
splendour.</p>
<p>My father would often say to Yorick, that if any mortal in the
whole universe had done such a thing except his brother Toby, it
would have been looked upon by the world as one of the most refined
satires upon the parade and prancing manner in which Lewis XIV.
from the beginning of the war, but particularly that very year, had
taken the field&mdash;But 'tis not my brother Toby's nature, kind
soul! my father would add, to insult any one.</p>
<p>&mdash;But let us go on.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXVI.</h2>
<p>I must observe, that although in the first year's campaign, the
word town is often mentioned,&mdash;yet there was no town at that
time within the polygon; that addition was not made till the summer
following the spring in which the bridges and sentry-box were
painted, which was the third year of my uncle Toby's
campaigns,&mdash;when upon his taking Amberg, Bonn, and Rhinberg,
and Huy and Limbourg, one after another, a thought came into the
corporal's head, that to talk of taking so many towns, without one
Town to shew for it,&mdash;was a very nonsensical way of going to
work, and so proposed to my uncle Toby, that they should have a
little model of a town built for them,&mdash;to be run up together
of slit deals, and then painted, and clapped within the interior
polygon to serve for all.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby felt the good of the project instantly, and
instantly agreed to it, but with the addition of two singular
improvements, of which he was almost as proud as if he had been the
original inventor of the project itself.</p>
<p>The one was, to have the town built exactly in the style of
those of which it was most likely to be the
representative:&mdash;with grated windows, and the gable ends of
the houses, facing the streets, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;as those in
Ghent and Bruges, and the rest of the towns in Brabant and
Flanders.</p>
<p>The other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the
corporal proposed, but to have every house independent, to hook on,
or off, so as to form into the plan of whatever town they pleased.
This was put directly into hand, and many and many a look of mutual
congratulation was exchanged between my uncle Toby and the
corporal, as the carpenter did the work.</p>
<p>&mdash;It answered prodigiously the next summer&mdash;the town
was a perfect Proteus&mdash;It was Landen, and Trerebach, and
Santvliet, and Drusen, and Hagenau,&mdash;and then it was Ostend
and Menin, and Aeth and Dendermond.</p>
<p>&mdash;Surely never did any Town act so many parts, since Sodom
and Gomorrah, as my uncle Toby's town did.</p>
<p>In the fourth year, my uncle Toby thinking a town looked
foolishly without a church, added a very fine one with a
steeple.&mdash;Trim was for having bells in it;&mdash;my uncle Toby
said, the metal had better be cast into cannon.</p>
<p>This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass
field-pieces, to be planted three and three on each side of my
uncle Toby's sentry-box; and in a short time, these led the way for
a train of somewhat larger,&mdash;and so on&mdash;(as must always
be the case in hobby-horsical affairs) from pieces of half an inch
bore, till it came at last to my father's jack boots.</p>
<p>The next year, which was that in which Lisle was besieged, and
at the close of which both Ghent and Bruges fell into our
hands,&mdash;my uncle Toby was sadly put to it for proper
ammunition;&mdash;I say proper ammunition&mdash;because his great
artillery would not bear powder; and 'twas well for the Shandy
family they would not&mdash;For so full were the papers, from the
beginning to the end of the siege, of the incessant firings kept up
by the besiegers,&mdash;and so heated was my uncle Toby's
imagination with the accounts of them, that he had infallibly shot
away all his estate.</p>
<p>Something therefore was wanting as a succedaneum, especially in
one or two of the more violent paroxysms of the siege, to keep up
something like a continual firing in the imagination,&mdash;and
this something, the corporal, whose principal strength lay in
invention, supplied by an entire new system of battering of his
own,&mdash;without which, this had been objected to by military
critics, to the end of the world, as one of the great desiderata of
my uncle Toby's apparatus.</p>
<p>This will not be explained the worse, for setting off, as I
generally do, at a little distance from the subject.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXVII.</h2>
<p>With two or three other trinkets, small in themselves, but of
great regard, which poor Tom, the corporal's unfortunate brother,
had sent him over, with the account of his marriage with the Jew's
widow&mdash;there was</p>
<p>A Montero-cap and two Turkish tobacco-pipes.</p>
<p>The Montero-cap I shall describe by and bye.&mdash;The Turkish
tobacco-pipes had nothing particular in them, they were fitted up
and ornamented as usual, with flexible tubes of Morocco leather and
gold wire, and mounted at their ends, the one of them with
ivory,&mdash;the other with black ebony, tipp'd with silver.</p>
<p>My father, who saw all things in lights different from the rest
of the world, would say to the corporal, that he ought to look upon
these two presents more as tokens of his brother's nicety, than his
affection.&mdash;Tom did not care, Trim, he would say, to put on
the cap, or to smoke in the tobacco-pipe of a Jew.&mdash;God bless
your honour, the corporal would say (giving a strong reason to the
contrary)&mdash;how can that be?</p>
<p>The Montero-cap was scarlet, of a superfine Spanish cloth, dyed
in grain, and mounted all round with fur, except about four inches
in the front, which was faced with a light blue, slightly
embroidered,&mdash;and seemed to have been the property of a
Portuguese quarter-master, not of foot, but of horse, as the word
denotes.</p>
<p>The corporal was not a little proud of it, as well for its own
sake, as the sake of the giver, so seldom or never put it on but
upon Gala-days; and yet never was a Montero-cap put to so many
uses; for in all controverted points, whether military or culinary,
provided the corporal was sure he was in the right,&mdash;it was
either his oath,&mdash;his wager,&mdash;or his gift.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Twas his gift in the present case.</p>
<p>I'll be bound, said the corporal, speaking to himself, to give
away my Montero-cap to the first beggar who comes to the door, if I
do not manage this matter to his honour's satisfaction.</p>
<p>The completion was no further off, than the very next morning;
which was that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the Lower
Deule, to the right, and the gate St. Andrew,&mdash;and on the
left, between St. Magdalen's and the river.</p>
<p>As this was the most memorable attack in the whole
war,&mdash;the most gallant and obstinate on both sides,&mdash;and
I must add the most bloody too, for it cost the allies themselves
that morning above eleven hundred men,&mdash;my uncle Toby prepared
himself for it with a more than ordinary solemnity.</p>
<p>The eve which preceded, as my uncle Toby went to bed, he ordered
his ramallie wig, which had laid inside out for many years in the
corner of an old campaigning trunk, which stood by his bedside, to
be taken out and laid upon the lid of it, ready for the
morning;&mdash;and the very first thing he did in his shirt, when
he had stepped out of bed, my uncle Toby, after he had turned the
rough side outwards,&mdash;put it on:&mdash;This done, he proceeded
next to his breeches, and having buttoned the waist-band, he
forthwith buckled on his sword-belt, and had got his sword half way
in,&mdash;when he considered he should want shaving, and that it
would be very inconvenient doing it with his sword on,&mdash;so
took it off:&mdash;In essaying to put on his regimental coat and
waistcoat, my uncle Toby found the same objection in his
wig,&mdash;so that went off too:&mdash;So that what with one thing
and what with another, as always falls out when a man is in the
most haste,&mdash;'twas ten o'clock, which was half an hour later
than his usual time, before my uncle Toby sallied out.</p>

<p>My uncle Toby had scarce turned the corner of his yew hedge,
which separated his kitchen-garden from his bowling-green, when he
perceived the corporal had begun the attack without him.&mdash;</p>
<p>Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal's apparatus;
and of the corporal himself in the height of his attack, just as it
struck my uncle Toby, as he turned towards the sentry-box, where
the corporal was at work,&mdash;for in nature there is not such
another,&mdash;nor can any combination of all that is grotesque and
whimsical in her works produce its equal.</p>
<p>The corporal&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Tread lightly on his ashes, ye men of genius,&mdash;for
he was your kinsman:</p>
<p>Weed his grave clean, ye men of goodness,&mdash;for he was your
brother.&mdash;Oh corporal! had I thee, but now,&mdash;now, that I
am able to give thee a dinner and protection,&mdash;how would I
cherish thee! thou should'st wear thy Montero-cap every hour of the
day, and every day of the week.&mdash;and when it was worn out, I
would purchase thee a couple like it:&mdash;But alas! alas! alas!
now that I can do this in spite of their reverences&mdash;the
occasion is lost&mdash;for thou art gone;&mdash;thy genius fled up
to the stars from whence it came;&mdash;and that warm heart of
thine, with all its generous and open vessels, compressed into a
clod of the valley!</p>
<p>&mdash;But what&mdash;what is this, to that future and dreaded
page, where I look towards the velvet pall, decorated with the
military ensigns of thy master&mdash;the first&mdash;the foremost
of created beings;&mdash;where, I shall see thee, faithful servant!
laying his sword and scabbard with a trembling hand across his
coffin, and then returning pale as ashes to the door, to take his
mourning horse by the bridle, to follow his hearse, as he directed
thee;&mdash;where&mdash;all my father's systems shall be baffled by
his sorrows; and, in spite of his philosophy, I shall behold him,
as he inspects the lackered plate, twice taking his spectacles from
off his nose, to wipe away the dew which nature has shed upon
them&mdash;When I see him cast in the rosemary with an air of
disconsolation, which cries through my ears,&mdash;O Toby! in what
corner of the world shall I seek thy fellow?</p>
<p>&mdash;Gracious powers! which erst have opened the lips of the
dumb in his distress, and made the tongue of the stammerer speak
plain&mdash;when I shall arrive at this dreaded page, deal not with
me, then, with a stinted hand.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXIX.</h2>
<p>The corporal, who the night before had resolved in his mind to
supply the grand desideratum, of keeping up something like an
incessant firing upon the enemy during the heat of the
attack,&mdash;had no further idea in his fancy at that time, than a
contrivance of smoking tobacco against the town, out of one of my
uncle Toby's six field-pieces, which were planted on each side of
his sentry-box; the means of effecting which occurring to his fancy
at the same time, though he had pledged his cap, he thought it in
no danger from the miscarriage of his projects.</p>
<p>Upon turning it this way, and that, a little in his mind, he
soon began to find out, that by means of his two Turkish
tobacco-pipes, with the supplement of three smaller tubes of
wash-leather at each of their lower ends, to be tagg'd by the same
number of tin-pipes fitted to the touch-holes, and sealed with clay
next the cannon, and then tied hermetically with waxed silk at
their several insertions into the Morocco tube,&mdash;he should be
able to fire the six field-pieces all together, and with the same
ease as to fire one.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may not be
cut out for the advancement of human knowledge. Let no man, who has
read my father's first and second beds of justice, ever rise up and
say again, from collision of what kinds of bodies light may or may
not be struck out, to carry the arts and sciences up to
perfection.&mdash;Heaven! thou knowest how I love them;&mdash;thou
knowest the secrets of my heart, and that I would this moment give
my shirt&mdash;Thou art a fool, Shandy, says Eugenius, for thou
hast but a dozen in the world,&mdash;and 'twill break thy
set.&mdash;</p>
<p>No matter for that, Eugenius; I would give the shirt off my back
to be burnt into tinder, were it only to satisfy one feverish
enquirer, how many sparks at one good stroke, a good flint and
steel could strike into the tail of it.&mdash;Think ye not that in
striking these in,&mdash;he might, per-adventure, strike something
out? as sure as a gun.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But this project, by the bye.</p>
<p>The corporal sat up the best part of the night, in bringing his
to perfection; and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon,
with charging them to the top with tobacco,&mdash;he went with
contentment to bed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXX.</h2>
<p>The corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle
Toby, in order to fix his apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot
or two before my uncle Toby came.</p>
<p>He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up
together in front of my uncle Toby's sentry-box, leaving only an
interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the three, on the right
and left, for the convenience of charging, &amp;c.&mdash;and the
sake possibly of two batteries, which he might think double the
honour of one.</p>
<p>In the rear and facing this opening, with his back to the door
of the sentry-box, for fear of being flanked, had the corporal
wisely taken his post:&mdash;He held the ivory pipe, appertaining
to the battery on the right, betwixt the finger and thumb of his
right hand,&mdash;and the ebony pipe tipp'd with silver, which
appertained to the battery on the left, betwixt the finger and
thumb of the other&mdash;and with his right knee fixed firm upon
the ground, as if in the front rank of his platoon, was the
corporal, with his Montero-cap upon his head, furiously playing off
his two cross batteries at the same time against the counter-guard,
which faced the counterscarp, where the attack was to be made that
morning. His first intention, as I said, was no more than giving
the enemy a single puff or two;&mdash;but the pleasure of the
puffs, as well as the puffing, had insensibly got hold of the
corporal, and drawn him on from puff to puff, into the very height
of the attack, by the time my uncle Toby joined him.</p>
<p>'Twas well for my father, that my uncle Toby had not his will to
make that day.</p>

corporal again, and raised it half way to his mouth&mdash;then
hastily gave it back a second time.</p>

smiled,&mdash;then looked grave,&mdash;then smiled for a
moment,&mdash;then looked serious for a long time;&mdash;Give me

peep over the horn-beam hedge;&mdash;never did my uncle Toby's

and get the rest of his military apparatus out of the
way;&mdash;that done, my dear friend Garrick, we'll snuff the
candles bright,&mdash;sweep the stage with a new broom,&mdash;draw

character, throughout which the world can have no idea how he will
act: and yet, if pity be a-kin to love,&mdash;and bravery no alien
to it, you have seen enough of my uncle Toby in these, to trace
these family likenesses, betwixt the two passions (in case there is
one) to your heart's content.</p>
<p>Vain science! thou assistest us in no case of this
kind&mdash;and thou puzzlest us in every one.</p>
<p>There was, Madam, in my uncle Toby, a singleness of heart which
misled him so far out of the little serpentine tracks in which
things of this nature usually go on; you can&mdash;you can have no
conception of it: with this, there was a plainness and simplicity
of thinking, with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the plies and
foldings of the heart of woman;&mdash;and so naked and defenceless
did he stand before you, (when a siege was out of his head,) that
you might have stood behind any one of your serpentine walks, and
shot my uncle Toby ten times in a day, through his liver, if nine
times in a day, Madam, had not served your purpose.</p>
<p>With all this, Madam,&mdash;and what confounded every thing as
much on the other hand, my uncle Toby had that unparalleled modesty
of nature I once told you of, and which, by the bye, stood eternal
sentry upon his feelings, that you might as soon&mdash;But where am

<p>Amongst the many ill consequences of the treaty of Utrecht, it
was within a point of giving my uncle Toby a surfeit of sieges; and
though he recovered his appetite afterwards, yet Calais itself left
not a deeper scar in Mary's heart, than Utrecht upon my uncle
Toby's. To the end of his life he never could hear Utrecht
mentioned upon any account whatever,&mdash;or so much as read an
article of news extracted out of the Utrecht Gazette, without
fetching a sigh, as if his heart would break in twain.</p>
<p>My father, who was a great Motive-Monger, and consequently a
very dangerous person for a man to sit by, either laughing or
crying,&mdash;for he generally knew your motive for doing both,
much better than you knew it yourself&mdash;would always console my
uncle Toby upon these occasions, in a way, which shewed plainly, he
imagined my uncle Toby grieved for nothing in the whole affair, so
much as the loss of his hobby-horse.&mdash;Never mind, brother
Toby, he would say,&mdash;by God's blessing we shall have another
war break out again some of these days; and when it does,&mdash;the
belligerent powers, if they would hang themselves, cannot keep us
out of play.&mdash;I defy 'em, my dear Toby, he would add, to take
countries without taking towns,&mdash;or towns without sieges.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby never took this back-stroke of my father's at his
hobby-horse kindly.&mdash;He thought the stroke ungenerous; and the
more so, because in striking the horse he hit the rider too, and in
the most dishonourable part a blow could fall; so that upon these
occasions, he always laid down his pipe upon the table with more
fire to defend himself than common.</p>
<p>I told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle Toby was
not eloquent; and in the very same page gave an instance to the
contrary:&mdash;I repeat the observation, and a fact which
contradicts it again.&mdash;He was not eloquent,&mdash;it was not
easy to my uncle Toby to make long harangues,&mdash;and he hated
florid ones; but there were occasions where the stream overflowed
the man, and ran so counter to its usual course, that in some parts
my uncle Toby, for a time, was at least equal to
Tertullus&mdash;but in others, in my own opinion, infinitely above
him.</p>
<p>My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical
orations of my uncle Toby's, which he had delivered one evening
before him and Yorick, that he wrote it down before he went to
bed.</p>
<p>I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my father's
papers, with here and there an insertion of his own, betwixt two
crooks, thus (.. .), and is endorsed,</p>
<p>My Brother Toby's Justification of His Own Principles and
Conduct in Wishing to Continue the War.</p>
<p>I may safely say, I have read over this apologetical oration of
my uncle Toby's a hundred times, and think it so fine a model of
defence,&mdash;and shews so sweet a temperament of gallantry and
good principles in him, that I give it the world, word for word
(interlineations and all), as I find it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXV.</h2>
<h3>My Uncle Toby's Apologetical Oration.</h3>
<p>I am not insensible, brother Shandy, that when a man whose
profession is arms, wishes, as I have done, for war,&mdash;it has
an ill aspect to the world;&mdash;and that, how just and right
soever his motives the intentions may be,&mdash;he stands in an
uneasy posture in vindicating himself from private views in doing
it.</p>
<p>For this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be
without being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter
his wish in the hearing of an enemy; for say what he will, an enemy
will not believe him.&mdash;He will be cautious of doing it even to
a friend,&mdash;lest he may suffer in his esteem:&mdash;But if his
heart is overcharged, and a secret sigh for arms must have its
vent, he will reserve it for the ear of a brother, who knows his
character to the bottom, and what his true notions, dispositions,
and principles of honour are: What, I hope, I have been in all
these, brother Shandy, would be unbecoming in me to say:&mdash;much
worse, I know, have I been than I ought,&mdash;and something worse,
perhaps, than I think: But such as I am, you, my dear brother
Shandy, who have sucked the same breasts with me,&mdash;and with
whom I have been brought up from my cradle,&mdash;and from whose
knowledge, from the first hours of our boyish pastimes, down to
this, I have concealed no one action of my life, and scarce a
thought in it&mdash;Such as I am, brother, you must by this time
know me, with all my vices, and with all my weaknesses too, whether
of my age, my temper, my passions, or my understanding.</p>
<p>Tell me then, my dear brother Shandy, upon which of them it is,
that when I condemned the peace of Utrecht, and grieved the war was
not carried on with vigour a little longer, you should think your
brother did it upon unworthy views; or that in wishing for war, he
should be bad enough to wish more of his fellow-creatures
slain,&mdash;more slaves made, and more families driven from their
peaceful habitations, merely for his own pleasure:&mdash;Tell me,
brother Shandy, upon what one deed of mine do you ground it? (The
devil a deed do I know of, dear Toby, but one for a hundred pounds,
which I lent thee to carry on these cursed sieges.)</p>
<p>If, when I was a school-boy, I could not hear a drum beat, but
my heart beat with it&mdash;was it my fault?&mdash;Did I plant the
propensity there?&mdash;Did I sound the alarm within, or
Nature?</p>
<p>When Guy, Earl of Warwick, and Parismus and Parismenus, and
Valentine and Orson, and the Seven Champions of England, were
handed around the school,&mdash;were they not all purchased with my
own pocket-money? Was that selfish, brother Shandy? When we read
over the siege of Troy, which lasted ten years and eight
months,&mdash;though with such a train of artillery as we had at
Namur, the town might have been carried in a week&mdash;was I not
as much concerned for the destruction of the Greeks and Trojans as
any boy of the whole school? Had I not three strokes of a ferula
given me, two on my right hand, and one on my left, for calling
Helena a bitch for it? Did any one of you shed more tears for
Hector? And when king Priam came to the camp to beg his body, and
returned weeping back to Troy without it,&mdash;you know, brother,
I could not eat my dinner.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Did that bespeak me cruel? Or because, brother Shandy, my
blood flew out into the camp, and my heart panted for
war,&mdash;was it a proof it could not ache for the distresses of
war too?</p>
<p>O brother! 'tis one thing for a soldier to gather
laurels,&mdash;and 'tis another to scatter cypress.&mdash;(Who told
thee, my dear Toby, that cypress was used by the antients on
mournful occasions?)</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis one thing, brother Shandy, for a soldier to hazard
his own life&mdash;to leap first down into the trench, where he is
sure to be cut in pieces:&mdash;'Tis one thing, from public spirit
and a thirst of glory, to enter the breach the first man,&mdash;to
stand in the foremost rank, and march bravely on with drums and
trumpets, and colours flying about his ears:&mdash;'Tis one thing,
I say, brother Shandy, to do this,&mdash;and 'tis another thing to
reflect on the miseries of war;&mdash;to view the desolations of
whole countries, and consider the intolerable fatigues and
hardships which the soldier himself, the instrument who works them,
is forced (for sixpence a day, if he can get it) to undergo.</p>
<p>Need I be told, dear Yorick, as I was by you, in Le Fever's
funeral sermon, That so soft and gentle a creature, born to love,
to mercy, and kindness, as man is, was not shaped for
this?&mdash;But why did you not add, Yorick,&mdash;if not by
Nature&mdash;that he is so by Necessity?&mdash;For what is war?
what is it, Yorick, when fought as ours has been, upon principles
of liberty, and upon principles of honour&mdash;what is it, but the
getting together of quiet and harmless people, with their swords in
their hands, to keep the ambitious and the turbulent within bounds?
And heaven is my witness, brother Shandy, that the pleasure I have
taken in these things,&mdash;and that infinite delight, in
particular, which has attended my sieges in my bowling-green, has
arose within me, and I hope in the corporal too, from the
consciousness we both had, that in carrying them on, we were
answering the great ends of our creation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXVI.</h2>
<p>I told the Christian reader&mdash;I say Christian&mdash;hoping
he is one&mdash;and if he is not, I am sorry for it&mdash;and only
beg he will consider the matter with himself, and not lay the blame
entirely upon this book&mdash;</p>
<p>I told him, Sir&mdash;for in good truth, when a man is telling a
story in the strange way I do mine, he is obliged continually to be
going backwards and forwards to keep all tight together in the
reader's fancy&mdash;which, for my own part, if I did not take heed
to do more than at first, there is so much unfixed and equivocal
matter starting up, with so many breaks and gaps in it,&mdash;and
so little service do the stars afford, which, nevertheless, I hang
up in some of the darkest passages, knowing that the world is apt
to lose its way, with all the lights the sun itself at noon-day can
give it&mdash;and now you see, I am lost myself&mdash;!</p>
<p>&mdash;But 'tis my father's fault; and whenever my brains come
to be dissected, you will perceive, without spectacles, that he has
left a large uneven thread, as you sometimes see in an unsaleable
piece of cambrick, running along the whole length of the web, and
so untowardly, you cannot so much as cut out a..., (here I hang up
a couple of lights again)&mdash;or a fillet, or a thumb-stall, but
it is seen or felt.&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXVII.</h2>
<p>I told the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter
which preceded my uncle Toby's apologetical oration,&mdash;though
in a different trope from what I should make use of now, That the
peace of Utrecht was within an ace of creating the same shyness
betwixt my uncle Toby and his hobby-horse, as it did betwixt the
queen and the rest of the confederating powers.</p>
<p>There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his
horse, which, as good as says to him, 'I'll go afoot, Sir, all the
days of my life before I would ride a single mile upon your back
again.' Now my uncle Toby could not be said to dismount his horse
in this manner; for in strictness of language, he could not be said
to dismount his horse at all&mdash;his horse rather flung
him&mdash;and somewhat viciously, which made my uncle Toby take it
ten times more unkindly. Let this matter be settled by
state-jockies as they like.&mdash;It created, I say, a sort of
shyness betwixt my uncle Toby and his hobby-horse.&mdash;He had no
occasion for him from the month of March to November, which was the
summer after the articles were signed, except it was now and then
to take a short ride out, just to see that the fortifications and
harbour of Dunkirk were demolished, according to stipulation.</p>
<p>The French were so backwards all that summer in setting about
that affair, and Monsieur Tugghe, the deputy from the magistrates
of Dunkirk, presented so many affecting petitions to the
queen,&mdash;beseeching her majesty to cause only her thunderbolts
to fall upon the martial works, which might have incurred her
displeasure,&mdash;but to spare&mdash;to spare the mole, for the
mole's sake; which, in its naked situation, could be no more than
an object of pity&mdash;and the queen (who was but a woman) being
of a pitiful disposition,&mdash;and her ministers also, they not
wishing in their hearts to have the town dismantled, for these
private reasons,...&mdash;...; so that the whole went heavily on
with my uncle Toby; insomuch, that it was not within three full
months, after he and the corporal had constructed the town, and put
it in a condition to be destroyed, that the several commandants,
commissaries, deputies, negociators, and intendants, would permit
him to set about it.&mdash;Fatal interval of inactivity!</p>
<p>The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a
breach in the ramparts, or main fortifications of the
town&mdash;No,&mdash;that will never do, corporal, said my uncle
Toby, for in going that way to work with the town, the English
garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if the French are
treacherous&mdash;They are as treacherous as devils, an' please
your honour, said the corporal&mdash;It gives me concern always
when I hear it, Trim, said my uncle Toby;&mdash;for they don't want
personal bravery; and if a breach is made in the ramparts, they may
enter it, and make themselves masters of the place when they
please:&mdash;Let them enter it, said the corporal, lifting up his
pioneer's spade in both his hands, as if he was going to lay about
him with it,&mdash;let them enter, an' please your honour, if they
dare.&mdash;In cases like this, corporal, said my uncle Toby,
slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane, and holding
it afterwards truncheon-wise with his fore-finger
extended,&mdash;'tis no part of the consideration of a commandant,
what the enemy dare,&mdash;or what they dare not do; he must act
with prudence. We will begin with the outworks both towards the sea
and the land, and particularly with fort Louis, the most distant of
them all, and demolish it first,&mdash;and the rest, one by one,
both on our right and left, as we retreat towards the
town;&mdash;then we'll demolish the mole,&mdash;next fill up the
harbour,&mdash;then retire into the citadel, and blow it up into
the air: and having done that, corporal, we'll embark for
England.&mdash;We are there, quoth the corporal, recollecting
himself&mdash;Very true, said my uncle Toby&mdash;looking at the
church.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXVIII.</h2>
<p>A delusive, delicious consultation or two of this kind, betwixt
my uncle Toby and Trim, upon the demolition of Dunkirk,&mdash;for a
moment rallied back the ideas of those pleasures, which were
slipping from under him:&mdash;still&mdash;still all went on
heavily&mdash;the magic left the mind the weaker&mdash;Stillness,
with Silence at her back, entered the solitary parlour, and drew
their gauzy mantle over my uncle Toby's head;&mdash;and
Listlessness, with her lax fibre and undirected eye, sat quietly
down beside him in his arm-chair.&mdash;No longer Amberg and
Rhinberg, and Limbourg, and Huy, and Bonn, in one year,&mdash;and
the prospect of Landen, and Trerebach, and Drusen, and Dendermond,
the next,&mdash;hurried on the blood:&mdash;No longer did saps, and
mines, and blinds, and gabions, and palisadoes, keep out this fair
enemy of man's repose:&mdash;No more could my uncle Toby, after
passing the French lines, as he eat his egg at supper, from thence
break into the heart of France,&mdash;cross over the Oyes, and with
all Picardie open behind him, march up to the gates of Paris, and
fall asleep with nothing but ideas of glory:&mdash;No more was he
to dream, he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the
Bastile, and awake with it streaming in his head.</p>
<p>&mdash;Softer visions,&mdash;gentler vibrations stole sweetly in
upon his slumbers;&mdash;the trumpet of war fell out of his
hands,&mdash;he took up the lute, sweet instrument! of all others
the most delicate! the most difficult!&mdash;how wilt thou touch
it, my dear uncle Toby?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXIX.</h2>
<p>Now, because I have once or twice said, in my inconsiderate way
of talking, That I was confident the following memoirs of my uncle
Toby's courtship of widow Wadman, whenever I got time to write
them, would turn out one of the most complete systems, both of the
elementary and practical part of love and love-making, that ever
was addressed to the world&mdash;are you to imagine from thence,
that I shall set out with a description of what love is? whether
part God and part Devil, as Plotinus will have it&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Or by a more critical equation, and supposing the whole
of love to be as ten&mdash;to determine with Ficinus, 'How many
parts of it&mdash;the one,&mdash;and how many the other;'&mdash;or
whether it is all of it one great Devil, from head to tail, as
Plato has taken upon him to pronounce; concerning which conceit of
his, I shall not offer my opinion:&mdash;but my opinion of Plato is
this; that he appears, from this instance, to have been a man of
much the same temper and way of reasoning with doctor Baynyard, who
being a great enemy to blisters, as imagining that half a dozen of
'em at once, would draw a man as surely to his grave, as a herse
and six&mdash;rashly concluded, that the Devil himself was nothing
in the world, but one great bouncing Cantharidis.&mdash;</p>
<p>I have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this
monstrous liberty in arguing, but what Nazianzen cried out (that
is, polemically) to Philagrius&mdash;</p>
<p>'(Greek)!' O rare! 'tis fine reasoning, Sir
indeed!&mdash;'(Greek)' and most nobly do you aim at truth, when
you philosophize about it in your moods and passions.</p>
<p>Nor is it to be imagined, for the same reason, I should stop to
inquire, whether love is a disease,&mdash;or embroil myself with
Rhasis and Dioscorides, whether the seat of it is in the brain or
liver;&mdash;because this would lead me on, to an examination of
the two very opposite manners, in which patients have been
treated&mdash;the one, of Aoetius, who always begun with a cooling
clyster of hempseed and bruised cucumbers;&mdash;and followed on
with thin potations of water-lilies and purslane&mdash;to which he
added a pinch of snuff, of the herb Hanea;&mdash;and where Aoetius
durst venture it,&mdash;his topaz-ring.</p>
<p>&mdash;The other, that of Gordonius, who (in his cap. 15. de
Amore) directs they should be thrashed, 'ad putorem
usque,'&mdash;till they stink again.</p>
<p>These are disquisitions which my father, who had laid in a great
stock of knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with in the
progress of my uncle Toby's affairs: I must anticipate thus much,
That from his theories of love, (with which, by the way, he
contrived to crucify my uncle Toby's mind, almost as much as his
amours themselves,)&mdash;he took a single step into
practice;&mdash;and by means of a camphorated cerecloth, which he
found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he was
making my uncle Toby a new pair of breeches, he produced
Gordonius's effect upon my uncle Toby without the disgrace.</p>
<p>What changes this produced, will be read in its proper place:
all that is needful to be added to the anecdote, is this&mdash;That
whatever effect it had upon my uncle Toby,&mdash;it had a vile
effect upon the house;&mdash;and if my uncle Toby had not smoaked
it down as he did, it might have had a vile effect upon my father
too.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;'Twill come out of itself by and bye.&mdash;All I contend
for is, that I am not obliged to set out with a definition of what
love is; and so long as I can go on with my story intelligibly,
with the help of the word itself, without any other idea to it,
than what I have in common with the rest of the world, why should I
differ from it a moment before the time?&mdash;When I can get on no
further,&mdash;and find myself entangled on all sides of this
mystic labyrinth,&mdash;my Opinion will then come in, in
course,&mdash;and lead me out.</p>
<p>At present, I hope I shall be sufficiently understood, in
telling the reader, my uncle Toby fell in love:</p>
<p>&mdash;Not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a
man is fallen in love,&mdash;or that he is deeply in love,&mdash;or
up to the ears in love,&mdash;and sometimes even over head and ears
in it,&mdash;carries an idiomatical kind of implication, that love
is a thing below a man:&mdash;this is recurring again to Plato's
opinion, which, with all his divinityship,&mdash;I hold to be
damnable and heretical:&mdash;and so much for that.</p>
<p>Let love therefore be what it will,&mdash;my uncle Toby fell
into it.</p>
<p>&mdash;And possibly, gentle reader, with such a
temptation&mdash;so wouldst thou: For never did thy eyes behold, or
thy concupiscence covet any thing in this world, more concupiscible
than widow Wadman.</p>

<p>As Susannah was informed by an express from Mrs. Bridget, of my
uncle Toby's falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before
it happened,&mdash;the contents of which express, Susannah
communicated to my mother the next day,&mdash;it has just given me
an opportunity of entering upon my uncle Toby's amours a fortnight
before their existence.</p>
<p>I have an article of news to tell you, Mr. Shandy, quoth my
mother, which will surprise you greatly.&mdash;</p>
<p>Now my father was then holding one of his second beds of
justice, and was musing within himself about the hardships of
matrimony, as my mother broke silence.&mdash;</p>
<p>'&mdash;My brother Toby,' quoth she, 'is going to be married to
Mrs. Wadman.'</p>
<p>&mdash;Then he will never, quoth my father, be able to lie
diagonally in his bed again as long as he lives.</p>
<p>It was a consuming vexation to my father, that my mother never
asked the meaning of a thing she did not understand.</p>
<p>&mdash;That she is not a woman of science, my father would
say&mdash;is her misfortune&mdash;but she might ask a
question.&mdash;</p>
<p>My mother never did.&mdash;In short, she went out of the world
at last without knowing whether it turned round, or stood
still.&mdash;My father had officiously told her above a thousand
times which way it was,&mdash;but she always forgot.</p>
<p>For these reasons, a discourse seldom went on much further
betwixt them, than a proposition,&mdash;a reply, and a rejoinder;
at the end of which, it generally took breath for a few minutes (as
in the affair of the breeches), and then went on again.</p>
<p>If he marries, 'twill be the worse for us,&mdash;quoth my
mother.</p>
<p>Not a cherry-stone, said my father,&mdash;he may as well batter
away his means upon that, as any thing else,</p>

proposition&mdash;the reply,&mdash;and the rejoinder, I told you

<p>I am now beginning to get fairly into my work; and by the help
of a vegetable diet, with a few of the cold seeds, I make no doubt
but I shall be able to go on with my uncle Toby's story, and my
own, in a tolerable straight line. Now,</p>
<p>(four very squiggly lines across the page signed Inv.T.S and
Scw.T.S)</p>
<p>These were the four lines I moved in through my first, second,
third, and fourth volumes (Alluding to the first edition.)&mdash;In
the fifth volume I have been very good,&mdash;the precise line I
have described in it being this:</p>
<p>(one very squiggly line across the page with loops marked
A,B,C,C,C,C,C,D)</p>
<p>By which it appears, that except at the curve, marked A. where I
took a trip to Navarre,&mdash;and the indented curve B. which is
the short airing when I was there with the Lady Baussiere and her
page,&mdash;I have not taken the least frisk of a digression, till
John de la Casse's devils led me the round you see marked
D.&mdash;for as for C C C C C they are nothing but parentheses, and
the common ins and outs incident to the lives of the greatest
ministers of state; and when compared with what men have
done,&mdash;or with my own transgressions at the letters
ABD&mdash;they vanish into nothing.</p>
<p>In this last volume I have done better still&mdash;for from the
end of Le Fever's episode, to the beginning of my uncle Toby's
campaigns,&mdash;I have scarce stepped a yard out of my way.</p>
<p>If I mend at this rate, it is not impossible&mdash;by the good
leave of his grace of Benevento's devils&mdash;but I may arrive
hereafter at the excellency of going on even thus:</p>
<p>(straight line across the page)</p>
<p>which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw it, by a
writing-master's ruler (borrowed for that purpose), turning neither
to the right hand or to the left.</p>
<p>This right line,&mdash;the path-way for Christians to walk in!
say divines&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The emblem of moral rectitude! says Cicero&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The best line! say cabbage planters&mdash;is the shortest
line, says Archimedes, which can be drawn from one given point to
another.&mdash;</p>
<p>I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart, in your
next birth-day suits!</p>
<p>&mdash;What a journey!</p>
<p>Pray can you tell me,&mdash;that is, without anger, before I
write my chapter upon straight lines&mdash;by what
mistake&mdash;who told them so&mdash;or how it has come to pass,
that your men of wit and genius have all along confounded this
line, with the line of Gravitation?</p>

<p>No&mdash;I think, I said, I would write two volumes every year,
provided the vile cough which then tormented me, and which to this
hour I dread worse than the devil, would but give me
leave&mdash;and in another place&mdash;(but where, I can't
recollect now) speaking of my book as a machine, and laying my pen
and ruler down cross-wise upon the table, in order to gain the
greater credit to it&mdash;I swore it should be kept a going at
that rate these forty years, if it pleased but the fountain of life
to bless me so long with health and good spirits.</p>
<p>Now as for my spirits, little have I to lay to their
charge&mdash;nay so very little (unless the mounting me upon a long
stick and playing the fool with me nineteen hours out of the
twenty-four, be accusations) that on the contrary, I have
much&mdash;much to thank 'em for: cheerily have ye made me tread
the path of life with all the burthens of it (except its cares)
upon my back; in no one moment of my existence, that I remember,
have ye once deserted me, or tinged the objects which came in my
way, either with sable, or with a sickly green; in dangers ye
gilded my horizon with hope, and when Death himself knocked at my
door&mdash;ye bad him come again; and in so gay a tone of careless
indifference, did ye do it, that he doubted of his
commission&mdash;</p>
<p>'&mdash;There must certainly be some mistake in this matter,'
quoth he.</p>
<p>Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be
interrupted in a story&mdash;and I was that moment telling Eugenius
a most tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied herself a
shell-fish, and of a monk damn'd for eating a muscle, and was
shewing him the grounds and justice of the procedure&mdash;</p>
<p>'&mdash;Did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a
scrape?' quoth Death. Thou hast had a narrow escape, Tristram, said
Eugenius, taking hold of my hand as I finished my story&mdash;</p>
<p>But there is no living, Eugenius, replied I, at this rate; for

<p>&mdash;You call him rightly, said Eugenius,&mdash;for by sin, we
are told, he enter'd the world&mdash;I care not which way he
enter'd, quoth I, provided he be not in such a hurry to take me out
with him&mdash;for I have forty volumes to write, and forty
thousand things to say and do which no body in the world will say
and do for me, except thyself; and as thou seest he has got me by
the throat (for Eugenius could scarce hear me speak across the
table), and that I am no match for him in the open field, had I not
better, whilst these few scatter'd spirits remain, and these two
spider legs of mine (holding one of them up to him) are able to
support me&mdash;had I not better, Eugenius, fly for my life? 'Tis
my advice, my dear Tristram, said Eugenius&mdash;Then by heaven! I
will lead him a dance he little thinks of&mdash;for I will gallop,
quoth I, without looking once behind me, to the banks of the
Garonne; and if I hear him clattering at my heels&mdash;I'll
scamper away to mount Vesuvius&mdash;from thence to Joppa, and from
Joppa to the world's end; where, if he follows me, I pray God he
may break his neck&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;He runs more risk there, said Eugenius, than thou.</p>
<p>Eugenius's wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from
whence it had been some months banish'd&mdash;'twas a vile moment
to bid adieu in; he led me to my chaise&mdash;Allons! said I; the
post-boy gave a crack with his whip&mdash;off I went like a cannon,
and in half a dozen bounds got into Dover.</p>

there is so much to be said by the several deputies from the towns

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXXVII.</h2>
<p>'Now before I quit Calais,' a travel-writer would say, 'it would
not be amiss to give some account of it.'&mdash;Now I think it very
much amiss&mdash;that a man cannot go quietly through a town and
let it alone, when it does not meddle with him, but that he must be
turning about and drawing his pen at every kennel he crosses over,
merely o' my conscience for the sake of drawing it; because, if we
may judge from what has been wrote of these things, by all who have
wrote and gallop'd&mdash;or who have gallop'd and wrote, which is a
different way still; or who, for more expedition than the rest,
have wrote galloping, which is the way I do at present&mdash;from
the great Addison, who did it with his satchel of school books
hanging at his a..., and galling his beast's crupper at every
stroke&mdash;there is not a gallopper of us all who might not have
gone on ambling quietly in his own ground (in case he had any), and
have wrote all he had to write, dry-shod, as well as not.</p>
<p>For my own part, as heaven is my judge, and to which I shall
ever make my last appeal&mdash;I know no more of Calais (except the
little my barber told me of it as he was whetting his razor) than I
do this moment of Grand Cairo; for it was dusky in the evening when
I landed, and dark as pitch in the morning when I set out, and yet
by merely knowing what is what, and by drawing this from that in
one part of the town, and by spelling and putting this and that
together in another&mdash;I would lay any travelling odds, that I
this moment write a chapter upon Calais as long as my arm; and with
so distinct and satisfactory a detail of every item, which is worth
a stranger's curiosity in the town&mdash;that you would take me for
the town-clerk of Calais itself&mdash;and where, sir, would be the
wonder? was not Democritus, who laughed ten times more than
I&mdash;town-clerk of Abdera? and was not (I forget his name) who
had more discretion than us both, town-clerk of Ephesus?&mdash;it
should be penn'd moreover, sir, with so much knowledge and good
sense, and truth, and precision&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.LXXXVIII.</h2>
<h3>Calais, Calatium, Calusium, Calesium.</h3>
<p>This town, if we may trust its archives, the authority of which
I see no reason to call in question in this place&mdash;was once no
more than a small village belonging to one of the first Counts de
Guignes; and as it boasts at present of no less than fourteen
thousand inhabitants, exclusive of four hundred and twenty distinct
families in the basse ville, or suburbs&mdash;it must have grown up
by little and little, I suppose, to its present size.</p>
<p>Though there are four convents, there is but one parochial
church in the whole town; I had not an opportunity of taking its
exact dimensions, but it is pretty easy to make a tolerable
conjecture of 'em&mdash;for as there are fourteen thousand
inhabitants in the town, if the church holds them all it must be
considerably large&mdash;and if it will not&mdash;'tis a very great
pity they have not another&mdash;it is built in form of a cross,
and dedicated to the Virgin Mary; the steeple, which has a spire to
it, is placed in the middle of the church, and stands upon four
pillars elegant and light enough, but sufficiently strong at the
same time&mdash;it is decorated with eleven altars, most of which
are rather fine than beautiful. The great altar is a master-piece
in its kind; 'tis of white marble, and, as I was told, near sixty
feet high&mdash;had it been much higher, it had been as high as
mount Calvary itself&mdash;therefore, I suppose it must be high
enough in all conscience.</p>
<p>There was nothing struck me more than the great Square; tho' I
cannot say 'tis either well paved or well built; but 'tis in the
heart of the town, and most of the streets, especially those in
that quarter, all terminate in it; could there have been a fountain
in all Calais, which it seems there cannot, as such an object would
have been a great ornament, it is not to be doubted, but that the
inhabitants would have had it in the very centre of this
square,&mdash;not that it is properly a square,&mdash;because 'tis
forty feet longer from east to west, than from north to south; so
that the French in general have more reason on their side in
calling them Places than Squares, which, strictly speaking, to be
sure, they are not.</p>
<p>The town-house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be
kept in the best repair; otherwise it had been a second great
ornament to this place; it answers however its destination, and
serves very well for the reception of the magistrates, who assemble
in it from time to time; so that 'tis presumable, justice is
regularly distributed.</p>
<p>I have heard much of it, but there is nothing at all curious in
the Courgain; 'tis a distinct quarter of the town, inhabited solely
by sailors and fishermen; it consists of a number of small streets,
neatly built and mostly of brick; 'tis extremely populous, but as
that may be accounted for, from the principles of their
diet,&mdash;there is nothing curious in that neither.&mdash;A
traveller may see it to satisfy himself&mdash;he must not omit
however taking notice of La Tour de Guet, upon any account; 'tis so
called from its particular destination, because in war it serves to
discover and give notice of the enemies which approach the place,
either by sea or land;&mdash;but 'tis monstrous high, and catches
the eye so continually, you cannot avoid taking notice of it if you
would.</p>
<p>It was a singular disappointment to me, that I could not have
permission to take an exact survey of the fortifications, which are
the strongest in the world, and which, from first to last, that is,
for the time they were set about by Philip of France, Count of
Bologne, to the present war, wherein many reparations were made,
have cost (as I learned afterwards from an engineer in
Gascony)&mdash;above a hundred millions of livres. It is very
remarkable, that at the Tete de Gravelenes, and where the town is
naturally the weakest, they have expended the most money; so that
the outworks stretch a great way into the campaign, and
consequently occupy a large tract of ground&mdash;However, after
all that is said and done, it must be acknowledged that Calais was
never upon any account so considerable from itself, as from its
situation, and that easy entrance which it gave our ancestors, upon
all occasions, into France: it was not without its inconveniences
also; being no less troublesome to the English in those times, than
Dunkirk has been to us, in ours; so that it was deservedly looked
upon as the key to both kingdoms, which no doubt is the reason that
there have arisen so many contentions who should keep it: of these,
the siege of Calais, or rather the blockade (for it was shut up
both by land and sea), was the most memorable, as it with-stood the
efforts of Edward the Third a whole year, and was not terminated at
last but by famine and extreme misery; the gallantry of Eustace de
St. Pierre, who first offered himself a victim for his
fellow-citizens, has rank'd his name with heroes. As it will not
take up above fifty pages, it would be injustice to the reader, not
to give him a minute account of that romantic transaction, as well
as of the siege itself, in Rapin's own words:</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XCI.</h2>
<p>When the precipitancy of a man's wishes hurries on his ideas
ninety times faster than the vehicle he rides in&mdash;woe be to
truth! and woe be to the vehicle and its tackling (let 'em be made
of what stuff you will) upon which he breathes forth the
disappointment of his soul!</p>
<p>As I never give general characters either of men or things in
choler, 'the most haste the worse speed,' was all the reflection I
made upon the affair, the first time it happen'd;&mdash;the second,
third, fourth, and fifth time, I confined it respectively to those
times, and accordingly blamed only the second, third, fourth, and
fifth post-boy for it, without carrying my reflections further; but
the event continuing to befal me from the fifth, to the sixth,
seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth time, and without one exception,
I then could not avoid making a national reflection of it, which I
do in these words;</p>
<p>That something is always wrong in a French post-chaise, upon
first setting out.</p>
<p>Or the proposition may stand thus:</p>
<p>A French postilion has always to alight before he has got three
hundred yards out of town.</p>
<p>What's wrong now?&mdash;Diable!&mdash;a rope's broke!&mdash;a
knot has slipt!&mdash;a staple's drawn!&mdash;a bolt's to
whittle!&mdash;a tag, a rag, a jag, a strap, a buckle, or a
buckle's tongue, want altering.</p>
<p>Now true as all this is, I never think myself impowered to
excommunicate thereupon either the post-chaise, or its
driver&mdash;nor do I take it into my head to swear by the living
G.., I would rather go a-foot ten thousand times&mdash;or that I
will be damn'd, if ever I get into another&mdash;but I take the
matter coolly before me, and consider, that some tag, or rag, or
jag, or bolt, or buckle, or buckle's tongue, will ever be a wanting
or want altering, travel where I will&mdash;so I never chaff, but
take the good and the bad as they fall in my road, and get
on:&mdash;Do so, my lad! said I; he had lost five minutes already,
in alighting in order to get at a luncheon of black bread, which he
had cramm'd into the chaise-pocket, and was remounted, and going
leisurely on, to relish it the better.&mdash;Get on, my lad, said
I, briskly&mdash;but in the most persuasive tone imaginable, for I
jingled a four-and-twenty sous piece against the glass, taking care
to hold the flat side towards him, as he look'd back: the dog
grinn'd intelligence from his right ear to his left, and behind his
sooty muzzle discovered such a pearly row of teeth, that
Sovereignty would have pawn'd her jewels for them.</p>
<p>Just heaven! What masticators!&mdash;/What bread&mdash;!</p>
<p>and so as he finished the last mouthful of it, we entered the
town of Montreuil.</p>

<p>There is not a town in all France which, in my opinion, looks
better in the map, than Montreuil;&mdash;I own, it does not look so
well in the book of post-roads; but when you come to see
it&mdash;to be sure it looks most pitifully.</p>
<p>There is one thing, however, in it at present very handsome; and
that is, the inn-keeper's daughter: She has been eighteen months at
Amiens, and six at Paris, in going through her classes; so knits,
and sews, and dances, and does the little coquetries very
well.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;A slut! in running them over within these five minutes
that I have stood looking at her, she has let fall at least a dozen
loops in a white thread stocking&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;I see, you
cunning gipsy!&mdash;'tis long and taper&mdash;you need not pin it
to your knee&mdash;and that 'tis your own&mdash;and fits you
exactly.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;That Nature should have told this creature a word about a
statue's thumb!</p>
<p>&mdash;But as this sample is worth all their
thumbs&mdash;besides, I have her thumbs and fingers in at the
bargain, if they can be any guide to me,&mdash;and as Janatone
withal (for that is her name) stands so well for a
drawing&mdash;may I never draw more, or rather may I draw like a
draught-horse, by main strength all the days of my life,&mdash;if I
do not draw her in all her proportions, and with as determined a
pencil, as if I had her in the wettest drapery.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But your worships chuse rather that I give you the
length, breadth, and perpendicular height of the great
parish-church, or drawing of the facade of the abbey of Saint
Austreberte which has been transported from Artois
hither&mdash;every thing is just I suppose as the masons and
carpenters left them,&mdash;and if the belief in Christ continues
so long, will be so these fifty years to come&mdash;so your
worships and reverences may all measure them at your
leisures&mdash;but he who measures thee, Janatone, must do it
now&mdash;thou carriest the principles of change within thy frame;
and considering the chances of a transitory life, I would not
answer for thee a moment; ere twice twelve months are passed and
gone, thou mayest grow out like a pumpkin, and lose thy
shapes&mdash;or thou mayest go off like a flower, and lose thy
beauty&mdash;nay, thou mayest go off like a hussy&mdash;and lose
thyself.&mdash;I would not answer for my aunt Dinah, was she
alive&mdash;'faith, scarce for her picture&mdash;were it but
painted by Reynolds&mdash;</p>
<p>But if I go on with my drawing, after naming that son of Apollo,
I'll be shot&mdash;</p>
<p>So you must e'en be content with the original; which, if the
evening is fine in passing thro' Montreuil, you will see at your
chaise-door, as you change horses: but unless you have as bad a
reason for haste as I have&mdash;you had better stop:&mdash;She has
a little of the devote: but that, sir, is a terce to a nine in your

<h2>Chapter 3.XCVI.</h2>
<p>'Make them like unto a wheel,' is a bitter sarcasm, as all the
learned know, against the grand tour, and that restless spirit for
making it, which David prophetically foresaw would haunt the
children of men in the latter days; and therefore, as thinketh the
great bishop Hall, 'tis one of the severest imprecations which
David ever utter'd against the enemies of the Lord&mdash;and, as if
he had said, 'I wish them no worse luck than always to be rolling
about.'&mdash;So much motion, continues he (for he was very
corpulent)&mdash;is so much unquietness; and so much of rest, by
the same analogy, is so much of heaven.</p>
<p>Now, I (being very thin) think differently; and that so much of
motion, is so much of life, and so much of joy&mdash;and that to
stand still, or get on but slowly, is death and the
devil&mdash;</p>
<p>Hollo! Ho!&mdash;the whole world's asleep!&mdash;bring out the
horses&mdash;grease the wheels&mdash;tie on the mail&mdash;and
drive a nail into that moulding&mdash;I'll not lose a
moment&mdash;</p>
<p>Now the wheel we are talking of, and whereinto (but not
whereonto, for that would make an Ixion's wheel of it) he curseth
his enemies, according to the bishop's habit of body, should
certainly be a post-chaise wheel, whether they were set up in
Palestine at that time or not&mdash;and my wheel, for the contrary
reasons, must as certainly be a cart-wheel groaning round its
revolution once in an age; and of which sort, were I to turn
commentator, I should make no scruple to affirm, they had great
store in that hilly country.</p>
<p>I love the Pythagoreans (much more than ever I dare tell my dear
Jenny) for their '(Greek)'&mdash;(their) 'getting out of the body,
in order to think well.' No man thinks right, whilst he is in it;
blinded as he must be, with his congenial humours, and drawn
differently aside, as the bishop and myself have been, with too lax
or too tense a fibre&mdash;Reason is, half of it, Sense; and the
measure of heaven itself is but the measure of our present
appetites and concoctions.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But which of the two, in the present case, do you think
to be mostly in the wrong?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XCVII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;But she did not know I was under a vow not to shave my
beard till I got to Paris;&mdash;yet I hate to make mysteries of
nothing;&mdash;'tis the cold cautiousness of one of those little
souls from which Lessius (lib. 13. de moribus divinis, cap. 24.)
hath made his estimate, wherein he setteth forth, That one Dutch
mile, cubically multiplied, will allow room enough, and to spare,
for eight hundred thousand millions, which he supposes to be as
great a number of souls (counting from the fall of Adam) as can
possibly be damn'd to the end of the world.</p>
<p>From what he has made this second estimate&mdash;unless from the
parental goodness of God&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I am much more at
a loss what could be in Franciscus Ribbera's head, who pretends
that no less a space than one of two hundred Italian miles
multiplied into itself, will be sufficient to hold the like
number&mdash;he certainly must have gone upon some of the old Roman
souls, of which he had read, without reflecting how much, by a
gradual and most tabid decline, in the course of eighteen hundred
years, they must unavoidably have shrunk so as to have come, when
he wrote, almost to nothing.</p>
<p>In Lessius's time, who seems the cooler man, they were as little
as can be imagined&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;We find them less now&mdash;</p>
<p>And next winter we shall find them less again; so that if we go
on from little to less, and from less to nothing, I hesitate not
one moment to affirm, that in half a century at this rate, we shall
have no souls at all; which being the period beyond which I doubt
likewise of the existence of the Christian faith, 'twill be one
advantage that both of 'em will be exactly worn out together.</p>
<p>Blessed Jupiter! and blessed every other heathen god and
goddess! for now ye will all come into play again, and with Priapus
at your tails&mdash;what jovial times!&mdash;but where am I? and
into what a delicious riot of things am I rushing? I&mdash;I who
must be cut short in the midst of my days, and taste no more of 'em
than what I borrow from my imagination&mdash;peace to thee,
generous fool! and let me go on.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.XCVIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;'So hating, I say, to make mysteries of nothing'&mdash;I
intrusted it with the post-boy, as soon as ever I got off the
stones; he gave a crack with his whip to balance the compliment;
and with the thill-horse trotting, and a sort of an up and a down
of the other, we danced it along to Ailly au clochers, famed in
days of yore for the finest chimes in the world; but we danced
through it without music&mdash;the chimes being greatly out of
order&mdash;(as in truth they were through all France).</p>
<p>And so making all possible speed, from</p>
<p>Ailly au clochers, I got to Hixcourt, from Hixcourt I got to
Pequignay, and from Pequignay, I got to Amiens, concerning which
town I have nothing to inform you, but what I have informed you
once before&mdash;and that was&mdash;that Janatone went there to

<h2>Chapter 3.XCIX.</h2>
<p>In the whole catalogue of those whiffling vexations which come
puffing across a man's canvass, there is not one of a more teasing
and tormenting nature, than this particular one which I am going to
describe&mdash;and for which (unless you travel with an
avance-courier, which numbers do in order to prevent
it)&mdash;there is no help: and it is this.</p>
<p>That be you in never so kindly a propensity to
sleep&mdash;though you are passing perhaps through the finest
country&mdash;upon the best roads, and in the easiest carriage for
doing it in the world&mdash;nay, was you sure you could sleep fifty
miles straight forwards, without once opening your eyes&mdash;nay,
what is more, was you as demonstratively satisfied as you can be of
any truth in Euclid, that you should upon all accounts be full as
well asleep as awake&mdash;nay, perhaps better&mdash;Yet the
incessant returns of paying for the horses at every
stage,&mdash;with the necessity thereupon of putting your hand into
your pocket, and counting out from thence three livres fifteen sous
(sous by sous), puts an end to so much of the project, that you
cannot execute above six miles of it (or supposing it is a post and
a half, that is but nine)&mdash;were it to save your soul from
destruction.</p>
<p>&mdash;I'll be even with 'em, quoth I, for I'll put the precise
sum into a piece of paper, and hold it ready in my hand all the
way: 'Now I shall have nothing to do,' said I (composing myself to
rest), 'but to drop this gently into the post-boy's hat, and not
say a word.'&mdash;Then there wants two sous more to drink&mdash;or
there is a twelve sous piece of Louis XIV. which will not
pass&mdash;or a livre and some odd liards to be brought over from
the last stage, which Monsieur had forgot; which altercations (as a
man cannot dispute very well asleep) rouse him: still is sweet
sleep retrievable; and still might the flesh weigh down the spirit,
and recover itself of these blows&mdash;but then, by heaven! you
have paid but for a single post&mdash;whereas 'tis a post and a
half; and this obliges you to pull out your book of post-roads, the
print of which is so very small, it forces you to open your eyes,
whether you will or no: Then Monsieur le Cure offers you a pinch of
snuff&mdash;or a poor soldier shews you his leg&mdash;or a
shaveling his box&mdash;or the priestesse of the cistern will water
your wheels&mdash;they do not want it&mdash;but she swears by her
priesthood (throwing it back) that they do:&mdash;then you have all
these points to argue, or consider over in your mind; in doing of
which, the rational powers get so thoroughly awakened&mdash;you may
get 'em to sleep again as you can.</p>
<p>It was entirely owing to one of these misfortunes, or I had
pass'd clean by the stables of Chantilly&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But the postillion first affirming, and then persisting
in it to my face, that there was no mark upon the two sous piece, I
open'd my eyes to be convinced&mdash;and seeing the mark upon it as
plain as my nose&mdash;I leap'd out of the chaise in a passion, and
so saw every thing at Chantilly in spite.&mdash;I tried it but for
three posts and a half, but believe 'tis the best principle in the
world to travel speedily upon; for as few objects look very
inviting in that mood&mdash;you have little or nothing to stop you;
by which means it was that I passed through St. Dennis, without
turning my head so much as on one side towards the Abby&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Richness of their treasury! stuff and
nonsense!&mdash;bating their jewels, which are all false, I would
not give three sous for any one thing in it, but Jaidas's
lantern&mdash;nor for that either, only as it grows dark, it might
be of use.</p>

Paris!&mdash;humph!&mdash;Paris! cried I, repeating the name the
third time&mdash;</p>
<p>The first, the finest, the most brilliant&mdash;</p>
<p>The streets however are nasty.</p>
<p>But it looks, I suppose, better than it smells&mdash;crack,
crack&mdash;crack, crack&mdash;what a fuss thou makest!&mdash;as if
it concerned the good people to be informed, that a man with pale
face and clad in black, had the honour to be driven into Paris at
nine o'clock at night, by a postillion in a tawny yellow jerkin,
turned up with red calamanco&mdash;crack, crack&mdash;crack,
crack&mdash;crack, crack,&mdash;I wish thy whip&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But 'tis the spirit of thy nation; so crack&mdash;crack
on.</p>
<p>Ha!&mdash;and no one gives the wall!&mdash;but in the School of
Urbanity herself, if the walls are besh..t&mdash;how can you do
otherwise?</p>
<p>And prithee when do they light the lamps? What?&mdash;never in
the summer months!&mdash;Ho! 'tis the time of sallads.&mdash;O
rare! sallad and soup&mdash;soup and sallad&mdash;sallad and soup,
encore&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis too much for sinners.</p>
<p>Now I cannot bear the barbarity of it; how can that
unconscionable coachman talk so much bawdy to that lean horse?
don't you see, friend, the streets are so villanously narrow, that
there is not room in all Paris to turn a wheelbarrow? In the
grandest city of the whole world, it would not have been amiss, if
they had been left a thought wider; nay, were it only so much in
every single street, as that a man might know (was it only for
satisfaction) on which side of it he was walking.</p>

on some great merry-meeting with the barbers, by joint consent had
said&mdash;Come, let us all go live at Paris: the French love good
eating&mdash;they are all gourmands&mdash;we shall rank high; if
their god is their belly&mdash;their cooks must be gentlemen: and
forasmuch as the periwig maketh the man, and the periwig-maker
maketh the periwig&mdash;ergo, would the barbers say, we shall rank

Capitouls (Chief Magistrate in Toulouse, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.)
at least&mdash;pardi! we shall all wear swords&mdash;</p>

candle-light,&mdash;but there is no depending upon it,) they
continued to do, to this day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.CI.</h2>
<p>The French are certainly misunderstood:&mdash;but whether the
fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves; or
speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would
expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so
likely to be contested by us&mdash;or whether the fault may not be
altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always
so critically as to know 'what they would be at'&mdash;I shall not
decide; but 'tis evident to me, when they affirm, 'That they who
have seen Paris, have seen every thing,' they must mean to speak of
those who have seen it by day-light.</p>
<p>As for candle-light&mdash;I give it up&mdash;I have said before,
there was no depending upon it&mdash;and I repeat it again; but not
because the lights and shades are too sharp&mdash;or the tints
confounded&mdash;or that there is neither beauty or keeping,
&amp;c....for that's not truth&mdash;but it is an uncertain light
in this respect, That in all the five hundred grand Hotels, which
they number up to you in Paris&mdash;and the five hundred good
things, at a modest computation (for 'tis only allowing one good
thing to a Hotel), which by candle-light are best to be seen, felt,
heard, and understood (which, by the bye, is a quotation from
Lilly)&mdash;the devil a one of us out of fifty, can get our heads
fairly thrust in amongst them.</p>
<p>This is no part of the French computation: 'tis simply this,</p>
<p>That by the last survey taken in the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixteen, since which time there have been considerable
augmentations, Paris doth contain nine hundred streets; (viz)</p>
<pre>
  In the quarter called the City&mdash;there are fifty-three streets.

  In St. Martin, fifty-four streets.

  In St. Bennet, sixty streets.
  In St. Andrews de Arcs, fifty-one streets.
  In the quarter of the Luxembourg, sixty-two streets.
</pre>
<p>And in that of St. Germain, fifty-five streets, into any of
which you may walk; and that when you have seen them with all that
belongs to them, fairly by day-light&mdash;their gates, their
bridges, their squares, their statues...and have crusaded it
moreover, through all their parish-churches, by no means omitting
St. Roche and Sulpice...and to crown all, have taken a walk to the
four palaces, which you may see, either with or without the statues
and pictures, just as you chuse&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Then you will have seen&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;but 'tis what no one needeth to tell you, for you will

<p>In mentioning the word gay (as in the close of the last chapter)
it puts one (i.e. an author) in mind of the word
spleen&mdash;especially if he has any thing to say upon it: not
that by any analysis&mdash;or that from any table of interest or
genealogy, there appears much more ground of alliance betwixt them,
than betwixt light and darkness, or any two of the most unfriendly
opposites in nature&mdash;only 'tis an undercraft of authors to
keep up a good understanding amongst words, as politicians do
amongst men&mdash;not knowing how near they may be under a
necessity of placing them to each other&mdash;which point being now
gain'd, and that I may place mine exactly to my mind, I write it
down here&mdash;</p>
<p>Spleen.</p>
<p>This, upon leaving Chantilly, I declared to be the best
principle in the world to travel speedily upon; but I gave it only
as matter of opinion. I still continue in the same
sentiments&mdash;only I had not then experience enough of its
working to add this, that though you do get on at a tearing rate,
yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same time; for which
reason I here quit it entirely, and for ever, and 'tis heartily at
any one's service&mdash;it has spoiled me the digestion of a good

the resources and hidden springs which sustain them: qualified as I
may be, by spending three days and two nights amongst them, and
during all that time making these things the entire subject of my
enquiries and reflections&mdash;</p>

dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd,</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.I.</h2>
<p>Now I hate to hear a person, especially if he be a traveller,
complain that we do not get on so fast in France as we do in
England; whereas we get on much faster, consideratis considerandis;
thereby always meaning, that if you weigh their vehicles with the
mountains of baggage which you lay both before and behind upon
them&mdash;and then consider their puny horses, with the very
little they give them&mdash;'tis a wonder they get on at all: their
suffering is most unchristian, and 'tis evident thereupon to me,
that a French post-horse would not know what in the world to do,
was it not for the two words...... and...... in which there is as
much sustenance, as if you give him a peck of corn: now as these
words cost nothing, I long from my soul to tell the reader what
they are; but here is the question&mdash;they must be told him
plainly, and with the most distinct articulation, or it will answer
no end&mdash;and yet to do it in that plain way&mdash;though their
reverences may laugh at it in the bed-chamber&mdash;full well I
wot, they will abuse it in the parlour: for which cause, I have
been volving and revolving in my fancy some time, but to no
purpose, by what clean device or facette contrivance I might so
modulate them, that whilst I satisfy that ear which the reader
chuses to lend me&mdash;I might not dissatisfy the other which he

<h2>Chapter 4.II.</h2>
<p>The abbess of Andouillets, which if you look into the large set
of provincial maps now publishing at Paris, you will find situated
amongst the hills which divide Burgundy from Savoy, being in danger
of an Anchylosis or stiff joint (the sinovia of her knee becoming
hard by long matins), and having tried every remedy&mdash;first,
prayers and thanksgiving; then invocations to all the saints in
heaven promiscuously&mdash;then particularly to every saint who had
ever had a stiff leg before her&mdash;then touching it with all the
reliques of the convent, principally with the thigh-bone of the man
of Lystra, who had been impotent from his youth&mdash;then wrapping
it up in her veil when she went to bed&mdash;then cross-wise her
rosary&mdash;then bringing in to her aid the secular arm, and
anointing it with oils and hot fat of animals&mdash;then treating
it with emollient and resolving fomentations&mdash;then with
poultices of marsh-mallows, mallows, bonus Henricus, white lillies
and fenugreek&mdash;then taking the woods, I mean the smoak of 'em,
holding her scapulary across her lap&mdash;then decoctions of wild
chicory, water-cresses, chervil, sweet cecily and
cochlearia&mdash;and nothing all this while answering, was
prevailed on at last to try the hot-baths of Bourbon&mdash;so
having first obtained leave of the visitor-general to take care of
her existence&mdash;she ordered all to be got ready for her
journey: a novice of the convent of about seventeen, who had been
troubled with a whitloe in her middle finger, by sticking it
constantly into the abbess's cast poultices, &amp;c.&mdash;had
gained such an interest, that overlooking a sciatical old nun, who
might have been set up for ever by the hot-baths of Bourbon,
Margarita, the little novice, was elected as the companion of the
journey.</p>
<p>An old calesh, belonging to the abbesse, lined with green frize,
was ordered to be drawn out into the sun&mdash;the gardener of the
convent being chosen muleteer, led out the two old mules, to clip
the hair from the rump-ends of their tails, whilst a couple of
lay-sisters were busied, the one in darning the lining, and the
other in sewing on the shreds of yellow binding, which the teeth of
time had unravelled&mdash;the under-gardener dress'd the muleteer's
hat in hot wine-lees&mdash;and a taylor sat musically at it, in a
shed over-against the convent, in assorting four dozen of bells for
the harness, whistling to each bell, as he tied it on with a
thong.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The carpenter and the smith of Andouillets held a council
of wheels; and by seven, the morning after, all look'd spruce, and
was ready at the gate of the convent for the hot-baths of
Bourbon&mdash;two rows of the unfortunate stood ready there an hour
before.</p>
<p>The abbess of Andouillets, supported by Margarita the novice,
advanced slowly to the calesh, both clad in white, with their black
rosaries hanging at their breasts&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;There was a simple solemnity in the contrast: they
entered the calesh; the nuns in the same uniform, sweet emblem of
innocence, each occupied a window, and as the abbess and Margarita
look'd up&mdash;each (the sciatical poor nun excepted)&mdash;each
stream'd out the end of her veil in the air&mdash;then kiss'd the
lilly hand which let it go: the good abbess and Margarita laid
their hands saint-wise upon their breasts&mdash;look'd up to
heaven&mdash;then to them&mdash;and look'd 'God bless you, dear
sisters.'</p>
<p>I declare I am interested in this story, and wish I had been
there.</p>
<p>The gardener, whom I shall now call the muleteer, was a little,
hearty, broad-set, good-natured, chattering, toping kind of a
fellow, who troubled his head very little with the hows and whens
of life; so had mortgaged a month of his conventical wages in a
borrachio, or leathern cask of wine, which he had disposed behind
the calesh, with a large russet-coloured riding-coat over it, to
guard it from the sun; and as the weather was hot, and he not a
niggard of his labours, walking ten times more than he
rode&mdash;he found more occasions than those of nature, to fall
back to the rear of his carriage; till by frequent coming and
going, it had so happen'd, that all his wine had leak'd out at the
legal vent of the borrachio, before one half of the journey was
finish'd.</p>
<p>Man is a creature born to habitudes. The day had been
sultry&mdash;the evening was delicious&mdash;the wine was
generous&mdash;the Burgundian hill on which it grew was
steep&mdash;a little tempting bush over the door of a cool cottage
at the foot of it, hung vibrating in full harmony with the
passions&mdash;a gentle air rustled distinctly through the
leaves&mdash;'Come&mdash;come, thirsty muleteer,&mdash;come
in.'</p>
<p>&mdash;The muleteer was a son of Adam, I need not say a word
more. He gave the mules, each of 'em, a sound lash, and looking in
the abbess's and Margarita's faces (as he did it)&mdash;as much as
to say 'here I am'&mdash;he gave a second good crack&mdash;as much
as to say to his mules, 'get on'&mdash;so slinking behind, he
enter'd the little inn at the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>The muleteer, as I told you, was a little, joyous, chirping
fellow, who thought not of to-morrow, nor of what had gone before,
or what was to follow it, provided he got but his scantling of
Burgundy, and a little chit-chat along with it; so entering into a
long conversation, as how he was chief gardener to the convent of
Andouillets, &amp;c. &amp;c. and out of friendship for the abbess
and Mademoiselle Margarita, who was only in her noviciate, he had
come along with them from the confines of Savoy, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;and as how she had got a white swelling by her
devotions&mdash;and what a nation of herbs he had procured to
mollify her humours, &amp;c. &amp;c. and that if the waters of
Bourbon did not mend that leg&mdash;she might as well be lame of
both&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;He so contrived his story,
as absolutely to forget the heroine of it&mdash;and with her the
little novice, and what was a more ticklish point to be forgot than
both&mdash;the two mules; who being creatures that take advantage
of the world, inasmuch as their parents took it of them&mdash;and
they not being in a condition to return the obligation downwards
(as men and women and beasts are)&mdash;they do it side-ways, and
long-ways, and back-ways&mdash;and up hill, and down hill, and
which way they can.&mdash;Philosophers, with all their ethicks,
have never considered this rightly&mdash;how should the poor
muleteer, then in his cups, consider it at all? he did not in the
least&mdash;'tis time we do; let us leave him then in the vortex of
his element, the happiest and most thoughtless of mortal
men&mdash;and for a moment let us look after the mules, the abbess,
and Margarita.</p>
<p>By virtue of the muleteer's two last strokes the mules had gone
quietly on, following their own consciences up the hill, till they
had conquer'd about one half of it; when the elder of them, a
shrewd crafty old devil, at the turn of an angle, giving a side
glance, and no muleteer behind them,&mdash;</p>
<p>By my fig! said she, swearing, I'll go no further&mdash;And if I
do, replied the other, they shall make a drum of my
hide.&mdash;</p>
<p>And so with one consent they stopp'd thus&mdash;</p>

I govern'd by this wicked stiff joint? why did I leave the convent
of Andouillets? and why didst thou not suffer thy servant to go
unpolluted to her tomb?</p>

word servant&mdash;why was I not content to put it here, or there,
any where rather than be in this strait?</p>

<p>My dear mother, quoth the novice, coming a little to
herself,&mdash;there are two certain words, which I have been told
will force any horse, or ass, or mule, to go up a hill whether he
will or no; be he never so obstinate or ill-will'd, the moment he
hears them utter'd, he obeys. They are words magic! cried the
abbess in the utmost horror&mdash;No; replied Margarita
calmly&mdash;but they are words sinful&mdash;What are they? quoth
the abbess, interrupting her: They are sinful in the first degree,
answered Margarita,&mdash;they are mortal&mdash;and if we are
ravished and die unabsolved of them, we shall both-but you may
pronounce them to me, quoth the abbess of Andouillets&mdash;They
cannot, my dear mother, said the novice, be pronounced at all; they
will make all the blood in one's body fly up into one's
face&mdash;But you may whisper them in my ear, quoth the
abbess.</p>
<p>Heaven! hadst thou no guardian angel to delegate to the inn at
the bottom of the hill? was there no generous and friendly spirit
unemployed&mdash;no agent in nature, by some monitory shivering,
creeping along the artery which led to his heart, to rouse the
muleteer from his banquet?&mdash;no sweet minstrelsy to bring back
the fair idea of the abbess and Margarita, with their black
rosaries!</p>
<p>Rouse! rouse!&mdash;but 'tis too late&mdash;the horrid words are
pronounced this moment&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;and how to tell them&mdash;Ye, who can speak of every
thing existing, with unpolluted lips&mdash;instruct me&mdash;guide

<h2>Chapter 4.VI.</h2>
<p>All sins whatever, quoth the abbess, turning casuist in the
distress they were under, are held by the confessor of our convent
to be either mortal or venial: there is no further division. Now a
venial sin being the slightest and least of all sins&mdash;being
halved&mdash;by taking either only the half of it, and leaving the
rest&mdash;or, by taking it all, and amicably halving it betwixt
yourself and another person&mdash;in course becomes diluted into no
sin at all.</p>
<p>Now I see no sin in saying, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, a hundred
times together; nor is there any turpitude in pronouncing the
syllable ger, ger, ger, ger, ger, were it from our matins to our
vespers: Therefore, my dear daughter, continued the abbess of
Andouillets&mdash;I will say bou, and thou shalt say ger; and then
alternately, as there is no more sin in fou than in bou&mdash;Thou
shalt say fou&mdash;and I will come in (like fa, sol, la, re, mi,
ut, at our complines) with ter. And accordingly the abbess, giving
the pitch note, set off thus:</p>
<pre>
     Abbess,.....)  Bou...bou...bou..
     Margarita,..)  &mdash;-ger,..ger,..ger.

     Margarita,..)  Fou...fou...fou..

<p>The two mules acknowledged the notes by a mutual lash of their
tails; but it went no further&mdash;'Twill answer by an' by, said
the novice.</p>

<p>Quicker still, cried Margarita. Fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou,
fou, fou, fou.</p>
<p>Quicker still, cried Margarita. Bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou,
bou, bou, bou.</p>
<p>Quicker still&mdash;God preserve me; said the abbess&mdash;They
do not understand us, cried Margarita&mdash;But the Devil does,

<p>What a tract of country have I run!&mdash;how many degrees
nearer to the warm sun am I advanced, and how many fair and goodly
cities have I seen, during the time you have been reading and
reflecting, Madam, upon this story! There's Fontainbleau, and Sens,
and Joigny, and Auxerre, and Dijon the capital of Burgundy, and
Challon, and Macon the capital of the Maconese, and a score more
upon the road to Lyons&mdash;and now I have run them over&mdash;I
might as well talk to you of so many market towns in the moon, as
tell you one word about them: it will be this chapter at the least,

<p>Alas! Madam, had it been upon some melancholy lecture of the
cross&mdash;the peace of meekness, or the contentment of
resignation&mdash;I had not been incommoded: or had I thought of
writing it upon the purer abstractions of the soul, and that food
of wisdom and holiness and contemplation, upon which the spirit of
man (when separated from the body) is to subsist for ever&mdash;You
would have come with a better appetite from it&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.VIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;All you need say of Fontainbleau (in case you are ask'd)
is, that it stands about forty miles (south something) from Paris,
in the middle of a large forest&mdash;That there is something great
in it&mdash;That the king goes there once every two or three years,
with his whole court, for the pleasure of the chace&mdash;and that,
during that carnival of sporting, any English gentleman of fashion
(you need not forget yourself) may be accommodated with a nag or
two, to partake of the sport, taking care only not to out-gallop
the king&mdash;</p>
<p>Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this
to every one.</p>
<p>First, Because 'twill make the said nags the harder to be got;
and</p>
<p>Secondly, 'Tis not a word of it true.&mdash;Allons!</p>
<p>As for Sens&mdash;you may dispatch&mdash;in a word&mdash;''Tis
an archiepiscopal see.'</p>
<p>&mdash;For Joigny&mdash;the less, I think, one says of it the
better.</p>
<p>But for Auxerre&mdash;I could go on for ever: for in my grand
tour through Europe, in which, after all, my father (not caring to
trust me with any one) attended me himself, with my uncle Toby, and
Trim, and Obadiah, and indeed most of the family, except my mother,
who being taken up with a project of knitting my father a pair of
large worsted breeches&mdash;(the thing is common sense)&mdash;and
she not caring to be put out of her way, she staid at home, at
Shandy Hall, to keep things right during the expedition; in which,
I say, my father stopping us two days at Auxerre, and his
researches being ever of such a nature, that they would have found
fruit even in a desert&mdash;he has left me enough to say upon
Auxerre: in short, wherever my father went&mdash;but 'twas more
remarkably so, in this journey through France and Italy, than in
any other stages of his life&mdash;his road seemed to lie so much
on one side of that, wherein all other travellers have gone before
him&mdash;he saw kings and courts and silks of all colours, in such
strange lights&mdash;and his remarks and reasonings upon the
characters, the manners, and customs of the countries we pass'd
over, were so opposite to those of all other mortal men,
particularly those of my uncle Toby and Trim&mdash;(to say nothing
of myself)&mdash;and to crown all&mdash;the occurrences and scrapes
which we were perpetually meeting and getting into, in consequence
of his systems and opiniotry&mdash;they were of so odd, so mix'd
and tragi-comical a contexture&mdash;That the whole put together,
it appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of
Europe, which was ever executed&mdash;that I will venture to
pronounce&mdash;the fault must be mine and mine only&mdash;if it be
not read by all travellers and travel-readers, till travelling is
no more,&mdash;or which comes to the same point&mdash;till the
world, finally, takes it into its head to stand still.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But this rich bale is not to be open'd now; except a
small thread or two of it, merely to unravel the mystery of my
father's stay at Auxerre.</p>
<p>&mdash;As I have mentioned it&mdash;'tis too slight to be kept
suspended; and when 'tis wove in, there is an end of it.</p>
<p>We'll go, brother Toby, said my father, whilst dinner is
coddling&mdash;to the abbey of Saint Germain, if it be only to see
these bodies, of which Monsieur Sequier has given such a
recommendation.&mdash;I'll go see any body, quoth my uncle Toby;
for he was all compliance through every step of the
journey&mdash;Defend me! said my father&mdash;they are all
mummies&mdash;Then one need not shave; quoth my uncle
Toby&mdash;Shave! no&mdash;cried my father&mdash;'twill be more
like relations to go with our beards on&mdash;So out we sallied,
the corporal lending his master his arm, and bringing up the rear,
to the abbey of Saint Germain.</p>
<p>Every thing is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and
very magnificent, said my father, addressing himself to the
sacristan, who was a younger brother of the order of
Benedictines&mdash;but our curiosity has led us to see the bodies,
of which Monsieur Sequier has given the world so exact a
description.&mdash;The sacristan made a bow, and lighting a torch
first, which he had always in the vestry ready for the purpose; he
led us into the tomb of St. Heribald&mdash;This, said the
sacristan, laying his hand upon the tomb, was a renowned prince of
the house of Bavaria, who under the successive reigns of
Charlemagne, Louis le Debonnair, and Charles the Bald, bore a great
sway in the government, and had a principal hand in bringing every
thing into order and discipline&mdash;</p>
<p>Then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in
the cabinet&mdash;I dare say he has been a gallant soldier&mdash;He
was a monk&mdash;said the sacristan.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby and Trim sought comfort in each other's
faces&mdash;but found it not: my father clapped both his hands upon
his cod-piece, which was a way he had when any thing hugely tickled
him: for though he hated a monk and the very smell of a monk worse
than all the devils in hell&mdash;yet the shot hitting my uncle
Toby and Trim so much harder than him, 'twas a relative triumph;
and put him into the gayest humour in the world.</p>
<p>&mdash;And pray what do you call this gentleman? quoth my
father, rather sportingly: This tomb, said the young Benedictine,
looking downwards, contains the bones of Saint Maxima, who came
from Ravenna on purpose to touch the body&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Of Saint Maximus, said my father, popping in with his
saint before him,&mdash;they were two of the greatest saints in the
whole martyrology, added my father&mdash;Excuse me, said the
sacristan&mdash;'twas to touch the bones of Saint Germain, the
builder of the abbey&mdash;And what did she get by it? said my
uncle Toby&mdash;What does any woman get by it? said my
father&mdash;Martyrdome; replied the young Benedictine, making a
bow down to the ground, and uttering the word with so humble, but
decisive a cadence, it disarmed my father for a moment. 'Tis
supposed, continued the Benedictine, that St. Maxima has lain in
this tomb four hundred years, and two hundred before her
canonization&mdash;'Tis but a slow rise, brother Toby, quoth my
father, in this self-same army of martyrs.&mdash;A desperate slow
one, an' please your honour, said Trim, unless one could
purchase&mdash;I should rather sell out entirely, quoth my uncle
Toby&mdash;I am pretty much of your opinion, brother Toby, said my
father.</p>
<p>&mdash;Poor St. Maxima! said my uncle Toby low to himself, as we
turn'd from her tomb: She was one of the fairest and most beautiful
ladies either of Italy or France, continued the sacristan&mdash;But
who the duce has got lain down here, besides her? quoth my father,
pointing with his cane to a large tomb as we walked on&mdash;It is
Saint Optat, Sir, answered the sacristan&mdash;And properly is
Saint Optat plac'd! said my father: And what is Saint Optat's
story? continued he. Saint Optat, replied the sacristan, was a
bishop&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I thought so, by heaven! cried my father, interrupting
him&mdash;Saint Optat!&mdash;how should Saint Optat fail? so
snatching out his pocket-book, and the young Benedictine holding
him the torch as he wrote, he set it down as a new prop to his
system of Christian names, and I will be bold to say, so
disinterested was he in the search of truth, that had he found a
treasure in Saint Optat's tomb, it would not have made him half so
rich: 'Twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to the
dead; and so highly was his fancy pleas'd with all that had passed
in it,&mdash;that he determined at once to stay another day in
Auxerre.</p>
<p>&mdash;I'll see the rest of these good gentry to-morrow, said my
father, as we cross'd over the square&mdash;And while you are
paying that visit, brother Shandy, quoth my uncle Toby&mdash;the
corporal and I will mount the ramparts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.IX.</h2>
<p>&mdash;Now this is the most puzzled skein of all&mdash;for in
this last chapter, as far at least as it has help'd me through
Auxerre, I have been getting forwards in two different journies
together, and with the same dash of the pen&mdash;for I have got
entirely out of Auxerre in this journey which I am writing now, and
I am got half way out of Auxerre in that which I shall write
hereafter&mdash;There is but a certain degree of perfection in
every thing; and by pushing at something beyond that, I have
brought myself into such a situation, as no traveller ever stood
before me; for I am this moment walking across the market-place of
Auxerre with my father and my uncle Toby, in our way back to
dinner&mdash;and I am this moment also entering Lyons with my
post-chaise broke into a thousand pieces&mdash;and I am moreover
this moment in a handsome pavillion built by Pringello (The same
Don Pringello, the celebrated Spanish architect, of whom my cousin
Antony has made such honourable mention in a scholium to the Tale
inscribed to his name. Vid. p.129, small edit.), upon the banks of
the Garonne, which Mons. Sligniac has lent me, and where I now sit
rhapsodising all these affairs.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.X.</h2>
<p>I am glad of it, said I, settling the account with myself, as I
walk'd into Lyons&mdash;my chaise being all laid higgledy-piggledy
with my baggage in a cart, which was moving slowly before
me&mdash;I am heartily glad, said I, that 'tis all broke to pieces;
for now I can go directly by water to Avignon, which will carry me
on a hundred and twenty miles of my journey, and not cost me seven
livres&mdash;and from thence, continued I, bringing forwards the
account, I can hire a couple of mules&mdash;or asses, if I like,
(for nobody knows me,) and cross the plains of Languedoc for almost
nothing&mdash;I shall gain four hundred livres by the misfortune
clear into my purse: and pleasure! worth&mdash;worth double the
money by it. With what velocity, continued I, clapping my two hands
together, shall I fly down the rapid Rhone, with the Vivares on my
right hand, and Dauphiny on my left, scarce seeing the ancient
cities of Vienne, Valence, and Vivieres. What a flame will it
rekindle in the lamp, to snatch a blushing grape from the Hermitage
and Cote roti, as I shoot by the foot of them! and what a fresh
spring in the blood! to behold upon the banks advancing and
retiring, the castles of romance, whence courteous knights have
whilome rescued the distress'd&mdash;and see vertiginous, the
rocks, the mountains, the cataracts, and all the hurry which Nature
is in with all her great works about her.</p>
<p>As I went on thus, methought my chaise, the wreck of which
look'd stately enough at the first, insensibly grew less and less
in its size; the freshness of the painting was no more&mdash;the
gilding lost its lustre&mdash;and the whole affair appeared so poor
in my eyes&mdash;so sorry!&mdash;so contemptible! and, in a word,
so much worse than the abbess of Andouillets' itself&mdash;that I
was just opening my mouth to give it to the devil&mdash;when a pert
vamping chaise-undertaker, stepping nimbly across the street,
demanded if Monsieur would have his chaise refitted&mdash;No, no,
said I, shaking my head sideways&mdash;Would Monsieur choose to
sell it? rejoined the undertaker&mdash;With all my soul, said
I&mdash;the iron work is worth forty livres&mdash;and the glasses
worth forty more&mdash;and the leather you may take to live on.</p>
<p>What a mine of wealth, quoth I, as he counted me the money, has
this post-chaise brought me in? And this is my usual method of
book-keeping, at least with the disasters of life&mdash;making a
penny of every one of 'em as they happen to me&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Do, my dear Jenny, tell the world for me, how I behaved
under one, the most oppressive of its kind, which could befal me as
a man, proud as he ought to be of his manhood&mdash;</p>
<p>'Tis enough, saidst thou, coming close up to me, as I stood with
my garters in my hand, reflecting upon what had not
pass'd&mdash;'Tis enough, Tristram, and I am satisfied, saidst
thou, whispering these words in my ear,..........
.........;&mdash;.........&mdash;any other man would have sunk down
to the centre&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Every thing is good for something, quoth I.</p>
<p>&mdash;I'll go into Wales for six weeks, and drink goat's
whey&mdash;and I'll gain seven years longer life for the accident.
For which reason I think myself inexcusable, for blaming Fortune so
often as I have done, for pelting me all my life long, like an
ungracious duchess, as I call'd her, with so many small evils:
surely, if I have any cause to be angry with her, 'tis that she has
not sent me great ones&mdash;a score of good cursed, bouncing
losses, would have been as good as a pension to me.</p>
<p>&mdash;One of a hundred a year, or so, is all I wish&mdash;I
would not be at the plague of paying land-tax for a larger.</p>

<p>To those who call vexations, Vexations, as knowing what they
are, there could not be a greater, than to be the best part of a
day at Lyons, the most opulent and flourishing city in France,
enriched with the most fragments of antiquity&mdash;and not be able
to see it. To be withheld upon any account, must be a vexation; but
to be withheld by a vexation&mdash;must certainly be, what
philosophy justly calls Vexation upon Vexation.</p>
<p>I had got my two dishes of milk coffee (which by the bye is
excellently good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and
coffee together&mdash;otherwise 'tis only coffee and
milk)&mdash;and as it was no more than eight in the morning, and
the boat did not go off till noon, I had time to see enough of
Lyons to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world
with it. I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking at my
list, and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of
Lippius of Basil, in the first place&mdash;</p>
<p>Now, of all things in the world, I understand the least of
mechanism&mdash;I have neither genius, or taste, or fancy&mdash;and
have a brain so entirely unapt for every thing of that kind, that I
solemnly declare I was never yet able to comprehend the principles
of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common knife-grinder's
wheel&mdash;tho' I have many an hour of my life look'd up with
great devotion at the one&mdash;and stood by with as much patience
as any christian ever could do, at the other&mdash;</p>
<p>I'll go see the surprising movements of this great clock, said
I, the very first thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to the
great library of the Jesuits, and procure, if possible, a sight of
the thirty volumes of the general history of China, wrote (not in
the Tartarean, but) in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese
character too.</p>
<p>Now I almost know as little of the Chinese language, as I do of
the mechanism of Lippius's clock-work; so, why these should have
jostled themselves into the two first articles of my list&mdash;I
leave to the curious as a problem of Nature. I own it looks like
one of her ladyship's obliquities; and they who court her, are
interested in finding out her humour as much as I.</p>
<p>When these curiosities are seen, quoth I, half addressing myself
to my valet de place, who stood behind me&mdash;'twill be no hurt
if we go to the church of St. Irenaeus, and see the pillar to which
Christ was tied&mdash;and after that, the house where Pontius
Pilate lived&mdash;'Twas at the next town, said the valet de
place&mdash;at Vienne; I am glad of it, said I, rising briskly from
my chair, and walking across the room with strides twice as long as
my usual pace&mdash;'for so much the sooner shall I be at the Tomb
of the two lovers.'</p>
<p>What was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long
strides in uttering this&mdash;I might leave to the curious too;
but as no principle of clock-work is concerned in it&mdash;'twill

<h2>Chapter 4.XII.</h2>
<p>O! there is a sweet aera in the life of man, when (the brain
being tender and fibrillous, and more like pap than any thing
else)&mdash;a story read of two fond lovers, separated from each
other by cruel parents, and by still more cruel destiny&mdash;</p>
<pre>
 Amandus&mdash;He
 Amanda&mdash;She&mdash;
 each ignorant of the other's course,
 He&mdash;east
 She&mdash;west
</pre>
<p>Amandus taken captive by the Turks, and carried to the emperor
of Morocco's court, where the princess of Morocco falling in love
with him, keeps him twenty years in prison for the love of his
Amanda.&mdash;</p>
<p>She&mdash;(Amanda) all the time wandering barefoot, and with
dishevell'd hair, o'er rocks and mountains, enquiring for
Amandus!&mdash;Amandus! Amandus!&mdash;making every hill and valley
to echo back his name&mdash;Amandus! Amandus! at every town and
city, sitting down forlorn at the gate&mdash;Has Amandus!&mdash;has
my Amandus enter'd?&mdash;till,&mdash;going round, and round, and
round the world&mdash;chance unexpected bringing them at the same
moment of the night, though by different ways, to the gate of
Lyons, their native city, and each in well-known accents calling
out aloud,</p>
<p>Is Amandus / Is my Amanda still alive?</p>
<p>they fly into each other's arms, and both drop down dead for
joy.</p>
<p>There is a soft aera in every gentle mortal's life, where such a
story affords more pabulum to the brain, than all the Frusts, and
Crusts, and Rusts of antiquity, which travellers can cook up for
it.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Twas all that stuck on the right side of the cullender
in my own, of what Spon and others, in their accounts of Lyons, had
strained into it; and finding, moreover, in some Itinerary, but in
what God knows&mdash;That sacred to the fidelity of Amandus and
Amanda, a tomb was built without the gates, where, to this hour,
lovers called upon them to attest their truths&mdash;I never could
get into a scrape of that kind in my life, but this tomb of the
lovers would, somehow or other, come in at the close&mdash;nay such
a kind of empire had it establish'd over me, that I could seldom
think or speak of Lyons&mdash;and sometimes not so much as see even
a Lyons-waistcoat, but this remnant of antiquity would present
itself to my fancy; and I have often said in my wild way of running
on&mdash;tho' I fear with some irreverence&mdash;'I thought this
shrine (neglected as it was) as valuable as that of Mecca, and so
little short, except in wealth, of the Santa Casa itself, that some
time or other, I would go a pilgrimage (though I had no other
business at Lyons) on purpose to pay it a visit.'</p>
<p>In my list, therefore, of Videnda at Lyons, this, tho'
last,&mdash;was not, you see, least; so taking a dozen or two of
longer strides than usual cross my room, just whilst it passed my
brain, I walked down calmly into the basse cour, in order to sally
forth; and having called for my bill&mdash;as it was uncertain
whether I should return to my inn, I had paid it&mdash;had moreover
given the maid ten sous, and was just receiving the dernier
compliments of Monsieur Le Blanc, for a pleasant voyage down the
Rhone&mdash;when I was stopped at the gate&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;'Twas by a poor ass, who had just turned in with a couple
of large panniers upon his back, to collect eleemosynary
turnip-tops and cabbage-leaves; and stood dubious, with his two
fore-feet on the inside of the threshold, and with his two hinder
feet towards the street, as not knowing very well whether he was to
go in or no.</p>
<p>Now, 'tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I cannot bear to
strike&mdash;there is a patient endurance of sufferings, wrote so
unaffectedly in his looks and carriage, which pleads so mightily
for him, that it always disarms me; and to that degree, that I do
not like to speak unkindly to him: on the contrary, meet him where
I will&mdash;whether in town or country&mdash;in cart or under
panniers&mdash;whether in liberty or bondage&mdash;I have ever
something civil to say to him on my part; and as one word begets
another (if he has as little to do as I)&mdash;I generally fall
into conversation with him; and surely never is my imagination so
busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his
countenance&mdash;and where those carry me not deep enough&mdash;in
flying from my own heart into his, and seeing what is natural for
an ass to think&mdash;as well as a man, upon the occasion. In
truth, it is the only creature of all the classes of beings below
me, with whom I can do this: for parrots, jackdaws, &amp;c.&mdash;I
never exchange a word with them&mdash;nor with the apes, &amp;c.
for pretty near the same reason; they act by rote, as the others
speak by it, and equally make me silent: nay my dog and my cat,
though I value them both&mdash;(and for my dog he would speak if he
could)&mdash;yet somehow or other, they neither of them possess the
talents for conversation&mdash;I can make nothing of a discourse
with them, beyond the proposition, the reply, and rejoinder, which
terminated my father's and my mother's conversations, in his beds
of justice&mdash;and those utter'd&mdash;there's an end of the
dialogue&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But with an ass, I can commune for ever.</p>
<p>Come, Honesty! said I,&mdash;seeing it was impracticable to pass
betwixt him and the gate&mdash;art thou for coming in, or going
out?</p>
<p>The ass twisted his head round to look up the street&mdash;</p>
<p>Well&mdash;replied I&mdash;we'll wait a minute for thy
driver:</p>
<p>&mdash;He turned his head thoughtful about, and looked wistfully
the opposite way&mdash;</p>
<p>I understand thee perfectly, answered I&mdash;If thou takest a
wrong step in this affair, he will cudgel thee to death&mdash;Well!
a minute is but a minute, and if it saves a fellow-creature a
drubbing, it shall not be set down as ill-spent.</p>
<p>He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went
on, and in the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger
and unsavouriness, had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen
times, and pick'd it up again&mdash;God help thee, Jack! said I,
thou hast a bitter breakfast on't&mdash;and many a bitter day's
labour,&mdash;and many a bitter blow, I fear, for its
wages&mdash;'tis all&mdash;all bitterness to thee, whatever life is
to others.&mdash;And now thy mouth, if one knew the truth of it, is
as bitter, I dare say, as soot&mdash;(for he had cast aside the
stem) and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this world, that
will give thee a macaroon.&mdash;In saying this, I pull'd out a
paper of 'em, which I had just purchased, and gave him
one&mdash;and at this moment that I am telling it, my heart smites
me, that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit, of seeing how
an ass would eat a macaroon&mdash;than of benevolence in giving him
one, which presided in the act.</p>
<p>When the ass had eaten his macaroon, I press'd him to come
in&mdash;the poor beast was heavy loaded&mdash;his legs seem'd to
tremble under him&mdash;he hung rather backwards, and as I pull'd
at his halter, it broke short in my hand&mdash;he look'd up pensive
in my face&mdash;'Don't thrash me with it&mdash;but if you will,
you may'&mdash;If I do, said I, I'll be d....d.</p>
<p>The word was but one-half of it pronounced, like the abbess of
Andouillet's&mdash;(so there was no sin in it)&mdash;when a person
coming in, let fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devil's
crupper, which put an end to the ceremony.</p>
<p>Out upon it! cried I&mdash;but the interjection was
equivocal&mdash;and, I think, wrong placed too&mdash;for the end of
an osier which had started out from the contexture of the ass's
panier, had caught hold of my breeches pocket, as he rush'd by me,
and rent it in the most disastrous direction you can
imagine&mdash;so that the</p>
<p>Out upon it! in my opinion, should have come in here&mdash;but
this I leave to be settled by</p>
<pre>
  The
  Reviewers
  of
  My Breeches,
</pre>
<p>which I have brought over along with me for that purpose.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XIV.</h2>
<p>When all was set to rights, I came down stairs again into the
basse cour with my valet de place, in order to sally out towards
the tomb of the two lovers, &amp;c.&mdash;and was a second time
stopp'd at the gate&mdash;not by the ass&mdash;but by the person
who struck him; and who, by that time, had taken possession (as is
not uncommon after a defeat) of the very spot of ground where the
ass stood.</p>
<p>It was a commissary sent to me from the post-office, with a
rescript in his hand for the payment of some six livres odd
sous.</p>
<p>Upon what account? said I.&mdash;'Tis upon the part of the king,
replied the commissary, heaving up both his shoulders&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;My good friend, quoth I&mdash;as sure as I am I&mdash;and
you are you&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And who are you? said he.&mdash;Don't puzzle me; said
I.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XV.</h2>
<p>&mdash;But it is an indubitable verity, continued I, addressing
myself to the commissary, changing only the form of my
asseveration&mdash;that I owe the king of France nothing but my
good will; for he is a very honest man, and I wish him all health
and pastime in the world&mdash;</p>
<p>Pardonnez moi&mdash;replied the commissary, you are indebted to
him six livres four sous, for the next post from hence to St. Fons,
in your route to Avignon&mdash;which being a post royal, you pay
double for the horses and postillion&mdash;otherwise 'twould have
amounted to no more than three livres two sous&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But I don't go by land; said I.</p>
<p>&mdash;You may if you please; replied the commissary&mdash;</p>
<p>Your most obedient servant&mdash;said I, making him a low
bow&mdash;</p>
<p>The commissary, with all the sincerity of grave good
breeding&mdash;made me one, as low again.&mdash;I never was more
disconcerted with a bow in my life.</p>
<p>&mdash;The devil take the serious character of these people!
quoth I&mdash;(aside) they understand no more of Irony than
this&mdash;</p>
<p>The comparison was standing close by with his panniers&mdash;but
something seal'd up my lips&mdash;I could not pronounce the
name&mdash;</p>
<p>Sir, said I, collecting myself&mdash;it is not my intention to
take post&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But you may&mdash;said he, persisting in his first
reply&mdash;you may take post if you chuse&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And I may take salt to my pickled herring, said I, if I
chuse&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But I do not chuse&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But you must pay for it, whether you do or no.</p>
<p>Aye! for the salt; said I (I know)&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And for the post too; added he. Defend me! cried
I&mdash;</p>
<p>I travel by water&mdash;I am going down the Rhone this very
afternoon&mdash;my baggage is in the boat&mdash;and I have actually
paid nine livres for my passage&mdash;</p>
<p>C'est tout egal&mdash;'tis all one; said he.</p>
<p>Bon Dieu! what, pay for the way I go! and for the way I do not
go!</p>
<p>&mdash;C'est tout egal; replied the commissary&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The devil it is! said I&mdash;but I will go to ten
thousand Bastiles first&mdash;</p>
<p>O England! England! thou land of liberty, and climate of good
sense, thou tenderest of mothers&mdash;and gentlest of nurses,
cried I, kneeling upon one knee, as I was beginning my
apostrophe.</p>
<p>When the director of Madam Le Blanc's conscience coming in at
that instant, and seeing a person in black, with a face as pale as
ashes, at his devotions&mdash;looking still paler by the contrast
and distress of his drapery&mdash;ask'd, if I stood in want of the
aids of the church&mdash;</p>
<p>I go by Water&mdash;said I&mdash;and here's another will be for
making me pay for going by Oil.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XVI.</h2>
<p>As I perceived the commissary of the post-office would have his
six livres four sous, I had nothing else for it, but to say some
smart thing upon the occasion, worth the money:</p>
<p>And so I set off thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And pray, Mr. Commissary, by what law of courtesy is a
defenceless stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use
a Frenchman in this matter?</p>
<p>By no means; said he.</p>
<p>Excuse me; said I&mdash;for you have begun, Sir, with first
tearing off my breeches-and now you want my pocket&mdash;</p>
<p>Whereas&mdash;had you first taken my pocket, as you do with your
own people&mdash;and then left me bare a..'d after&mdash;I had been
a beast to have complain'd&mdash;</p>
<p>As it is&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis contrary to the law of nature.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis contrary to reason.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis contrary to the Gospel.</p>
<p>But not to this&mdash;said he&mdash;putting a printed paper into
my hand,</p>
<p>Par le Roy.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis a pithy prolegomenon, quoth I&mdash;and so read
on....</p>
<p>&mdash;By all which it appears, quoth I, having read it over, a
little too rapidly, that if a man sets out in a post-chaise from
Paris&mdash;he must go on travelling in one, all the days of his
life&mdash;or pay for it.&mdash;Excuse me, said the commissary, the
spirit of the ordinance is this&mdash;That if you set out with an
intention of running post from Paris to Avignon, &amp;c. you shall
not change that intention or mode of travelling, without first
satisfying the fermiers for two posts further than the place you
repent at&mdash;and 'tis founded, continued he, upon this, that the
Revenues are not to fall short through your fickleness&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;O by heavens! cried I&mdash;if fickleness is taxable in
France&mdash;we have nothing to do but to make the best peace with
you we can&mdash;</p>
<p>And So the Peace Was Made;</p>
<p>&mdash;And if it is a bad one&mdash;as Tristram Shandy laid the
corner-stone of it&mdash;nobody but Tristram Shandy ought to be
hanged.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XVII.</h2>
<p>Though I was sensible I had said as many clever things to the
commissary as came to six livres four sous, yet I was determined to
note down the imposition amongst my remarks before I retired from
the place; so putting my hand into my coat-pocket for my
remarks&mdash;(which, by the bye, may be a caution to travellers to
take a little more care of their remarks for the future) 'my
remarks were stolen'&mdash;Never did sorry traveller make such a
pother and racket about his remarks as I did about mine, upon the
occasion.</p>
<p>Heaven! earth! sea! fire! cried I, calling in every thing to my
aid but what I should&mdash;My remarks are stolen!&mdash;what shall
I do?&mdash;Mr. Commissary! pray did I drop any remarks, as I stood
besides you?&mdash;</p>
<p>You dropp'd a good many very singular ones; replied
he&mdash;Pugh! said I, those were but a few, not worth above six
livres two sous&mdash;but these are a large parcel&mdash;He shook
his head&mdash;Monsieur Le Blanc! Madam Le Blanc! did you see any
papers of mine?&mdash;you maid of the house! run up
stairs&mdash;Francois! run up after her&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I must have my remarks&mdash;they were the best remarks,
cried I, that ever were made&mdash;the wisest&mdash;the
wittiest&mdash;What shall I do?&mdash;which way shall I turn
myself?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XVIII.</h2>
<p>When the first transport was over, and the registers of the
brain were beginning to get a little out of the confusion into
which this jumble of cross accidents had cast them&mdash;it then
presently occurr'd to me, that I had left my remarks in the pocket
of the chaise&mdash;and that in selling my chaise, I had sold my
remarks along with it, to the chaise-vamper. I leave this void
space that the reader may swear into it any oath that he is most
accustomed to&mdash;For my own part, if ever I swore a whole oath
into a vacancy in my life, I think it was into
that&mdash;........., said I&mdash;and so my remarks through
France, which were as full of wit, as an egg is full of meat, and
as well worth four hundred guineas, as the said egg is worth a
penny&mdash;have I been selling here to a chaise-vamper&mdash;for
four Louis d'Ors&mdash;and giving him a post-chaise (by heaven)
worth six into the bargain; had it been to Dodsley, or Becket, or
any creditable bookseller, who was either leaving off business, and
wanted a post-chaise&mdash;or who was beginning it&mdash;and wanted
my remarks, and two or three guineas along with them&mdash;I could
have borne it&mdash;but to a chaise-vamper!&mdash;shew me to him
this moment, Francois,&mdash;said I&mdash;The valet de place put on
his hat, and led the way&mdash;and I pull'd off mine, as I pass'd
the commissary, and followed him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XIX.</h2>
<p>When we arrived at the chaise-vamper's house, both the house and
the shop were shut up; it was the eighth of September, the nativity
of the blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Tantarra-ra-tan-tivi&mdash;the whole world was gone out a
May-poling&mdash;frisking here&mdash;capering there&mdash;no body
cared a button for me or my remarks; so I sat me down upon a bench
by the door, philosophating upon my condition: by a better fate
than usually attends me, I had not waited half an hour, when the
mistress came in to take the papilliotes from off her hair, before
she went to the May-poles&mdash;</p>
<p>The French women, by the bye, love May-poles, a la
folie&mdash;that is, as much as their matins&mdash;give 'em but a
May-pole, whether in May, June, July or September&mdash;they never
count the times&mdash;down it goes&mdash;'tis meat, drink, washing,
and lodging to 'em&mdash;and had we but the policy, an' please your
worships (as wood is a little scarce in France), to send them but
plenty of May-poles&mdash;</p>
<p>The women would set them up; and when they had done, they would
dance round them (and the men for company) till they were all
blind.</p>
<p>The wife of the chaise-vamper stepp'd in, I told you, to take
the papilliotes from off her hair&mdash;the toilet stands still for
no man&mdash;so she jerk'd off her cap, to begin with them as she
open'd the door, in doing which, one of them fell upon the
ground&mdash;I instantly saw it was my own writing&mdash;</p>
<p>O Seigneur! cried I&mdash;you have got all my remarks upon your
head, Madam!&mdash;J'en suis bien mortifiee, said she&mdash;'tis
well, thinks I, they have stuck there&mdash;for could they have
gone deeper, they would have made such confusion in a French
woman's noddle&mdash;She had better have gone with it unfrizled, to
the day of eternity.</p>
<p>Tenez&mdash;said she&mdash;so without any idea of the nature of
my suffering, she took them from her curls, and put them gravely
one by one into my hat&mdash;one was twisted this way&mdash;another
twisted that&mdash;ey! by my faith; and when they are published,
quoth I,&mdash;</p>
<p>They will be worse twisted still.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XX.</h2>
<p>And now for Lippius's clock! said I, with the air of a man, who
had got thro' all his difficulties&mdash;nothing can prevent us
seeing that, and the Chinese history, &amp;c. except the time, said
Francois&mdash;for 'tis almost eleven&mdash;then we must speed the
faster, said I, striding it away to the cathedral.</p>
<p>I cannot say, in my heart, that it gave me any concern in being
told by one of the minor canons, as I was entering the west
door,&mdash;That Lippius's great clock was all out of joints, and
had not gone for some years&mdash;It will give me the more time,
thought I, to peruse the Chinese history; and besides I shall be
able to give the world a better account of the clock in its decay,
than I could have done in its flourishing condition&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And so away I posted to the college of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of
China in Chinese characters&mdash;as with many others I could
mention, which strike the fancy only at a distance; for as I came
nearer and nearer to the point&mdash;my blood cool'd&mdash;the
freak gradually went off, till at length I would not have given a
cherry-stone to have it gratified&mdash;The truth was, my time was
short, and my heart was at the Tomb of the Lovers&mdash;I wish to
God, said I, as I got the rapper in my hand, that the key of the
library may be but lost; it fell out as well&mdash;</p>

I had lived twenty years in Lyons, namely, that it was upon the
turning of my right hand, just without the gate, leading to the
Fauxbourg de Vaise&mdash;I dispatched Francois to the boat, that I
might pay the homage I so long ow'd it, without a witness of my
weakness&mdash;I walk'd with all imaginable joy towards the
place&mdash;when I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb, my
heart glowed within me&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XXII.</h2>
<p>No matter how, or in what mood&mdash;but I flew from the tomb of
the lovers&mdash;or rather I did not fly from it&mdash;(for there
was no such thing existing) and just got time enough to the boat to
save my passage;&mdash;and ere I had sailed a hundred yards, the
Rhone and the Saon met together, and carried me down merrily
betwixt them.</p>
<p>But I have described this voyage down the Rhone, before I made
it&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;So now I am at Avignon, and as there is nothing to see
but the old house, in which the duke of Ormond resided, and nothing
to stop me but a short remark upon the place, in three minutes you
will see me crossing the bridge upon a mule, with Francois upon a
horse with my portmanteau behind him, and the owner of both,
striding the way before us, with a long gun upon his shoulder, and
a sword under his arm, lest peradventure we should run away with
his cattle. Had you seen my breeches in entering
Avignon,&mdash;Though you'd have seen them better, I think, as I
mounted&mdash;you would not have thought the precaution amiss, or
found in your heart to have taken it in dudgeon; for my own part, I
took it most kindly; and determined to make him a present of them,
when we got to the end of our journey, for the trouble they had put
him to, of arming himself at all points against them.</p>
<p>Before I go further, let me get rid of my remark upon Avignon,
which is this: That I think it wrong, merely because a man's hat
has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes to
Avignon,&mdash;that he should therefore say, 'Avignon is more
subject to high winds than any town in all France:' for which
reason I laid no stress upon the accident till I had enquired of
the master of the inn about it, who telling me seriously it was
so&mdash;and hearing, moreover, the windiness of Avignon spoke of
in the country about as a proverb&mdash;I set it down, merely to
ask the learned what can be the cause&mdash;the consequence I
saw&mdash;for they are all Dukes, Marquisses, and Counts,
there&mdash;the duce a Baron, in all Avignon&mdash;so that there is
scarce any talking to them on a windy day.</p>
<p>Prithee, friend, said I, take hold of my mule for a
moment&mdash;for I wanted to pull off one of my jack-boots, which

the inn, and as I had taken it into my head, he was someway
concerned about the house or stable, I put the bridle into his
hand&mdash;so begun with the boot:&mdash;when I had finished the
affair, I turned about to take the mule from the man, and thank
him&mdash;</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XXIII.</h2>
<p>I had now the whole south of France, from the banks of the Rhone
to those of the Garonne, to traverse upon my mule at my own
leisure&mdash;at my own leisure&mdash;for I had left Death, the
Lord knows&mdash;and He only&mdash;how far behind me&mdash;'I have
followed many a man thro' France, quoth he&mdash;but never at this
mettlesome rate.'&mdash;Still he followed,&mdash;and still I fled
him&mdash;but I fled him cheerfully&mdash;still he
pursued&mdash;but, like one who pursued his prey without
hope&mdash;as he lagg'd, every step he lost, softened his
looks&mdash;why should I fly him at this rate?</p>
<p>So notwithstanding all the commissary of the post-office had
said, I changed the mode of my travelling once more; and, after so
precipitate and rattling a course as I had run, I flattered my
fancy with thinking of my mule, and that I should traverse the rich
plains of Languedoc upon his back, as slowly as foot could
fall.</p>
<p>There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller&mdash;or more
terrible to travel-writers, than a large rich plain; especially if
it is without great rivers or bridges; and presents nothing to the
eye, but one unvaried picture of plenty: for after they have once
told you, that 'tis delicious! or delightful! (as the case
happens)&mdash;that the soil was grateful, and that nature pours
out all her abundance, &amp;c...they have then a large plain upon
their hands, which they know not what to do with&mdash;and which is
of little or no use to them but to carry them to some town; and
that town, perhaps of little more, but a new place to start from to
the next plain&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>&mdash;This is most terrible work; judge if I don't manage my
plains better.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XXIV.</h2>
<p>I had not gone above two leagues and a half, before the man with
his gun began to look at his priming.</p>
<p>I had three several times loiter'd terribly behind; half a mile
at least every time; once, in deep conference with a drum-maker,
who was making drums for the fairs of Baucaira and
Tarascone&mdash;I did not understand the principles&mdash;</p>
<p>The second time, I cannot so properly say, I stopp'd&mdash;for
meeting a couple of Franciscans straitened more for time than
myself, and not being able to get to the bottom of what I was
about&mdash;I had turn'd back with them&mdash;</p>
<p>The third, was an affair of trade with a gossip, for a
hand-basket of Provence figs for four sous; this would have been
transacted at once; but for a case of conscience at the close of
it; for when the figs were paid for, it turn'd out, that there were
two dozen of eggs covered over with vine-leaves at the bottom of
the basket&mdash;as I had no intention of buying eggs&mdash;I made
no sort of claim of them&mdash;as for the space they had
occupied&mdash;what signified it? I had figs enow for my
money&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But it was my intention to have the basket&mdash;it was
the gossip's intention to keep it, without which, she could do
nothing with her eggs&mdash;and unless I had the basket, I could do
as little with my figs, which were too ripe already, and most of
'em burst at the side: this brought on a short contention, which
terminated in sundry proposals, what we should both do&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;How we disposed of our eggs and figs, I defy you, or the
Devil himself, had he not been there (which I am persuaded he was),
to form the least probable conjecture: You will read the whole of
it&mdash;not this year, for I am hastening to the story of my uncle
Toby's amours&mdash;but you will read it in the collection of those
which have arose out of the journey across this plain&mdash;and
which, therefore, I call my</p>
<p>Plain Stories.</p>
<p>How far my pen has been fatigued, like those of other
travellers, in this journey of it, over so barren a track&mdash;the
world must judge&mdash;but the traces of it, which are now all set
o' vibrating together this moment, tell me 'tis the most fruitful
and busy period of my life; for as I had made no convention with my
man with the gun, as to time&mdash;by stopping and talking to every
soul I met, who was not in a full trot&mdash;joining all parties
before me&mdash;waiting for every soul behind&mdash;hailing all
those who were coming through cross-roads&mdash;arresting all kinds
of beggars, pilgrims, fiddlers, friars&mdash;not passing by a woman
in a mulberry-tree without commending her legs, and tempting her
into conversation with a pinch of snuff&mdash;In short, by seizing
every handle, of what size or shape soever, which chance held out
to me in this journey&mdash;I turned my plain into a city&mdash;I
was always in company, and with great variety too; and as my mule
loved society as much as myself, and had some proposals always on
his part to offer to every beast he met&mdash;I am confident we
could have passed through Pall-Mall, or St. James's-Street, for a
month together, with fewer adventures&mdash;and seen less of human
nature.</p>
<p>O! there is that sprightly frankness, which at once unpins every
plait of a Languedocian's dress&mdash;that whatever is beneath it,
it looks so like the simplicity which poets sing of in better
days&mdash;I will delude my fancy, and believe it is so.</p>
<p>'Twas in the road betwixt Nismes and Lunel, where there is the
best Muscatto wine in all France, and which by the bye belongs to
the honest canons of Montpellier&mdash;and foul befal the man who
has drunk it at their table, who grudges them a drop of it.</p>
<p>&mdash;The sun was set&mdash;they had done their work; the
nymphs had tied up their hair afresh&mdash;and the swains were
preparing for a carousal&mdash;my mule made a dead point&mdash;'Tis
the fife and tabourin, said I&mdash;I'm frighten'd to death, quoth
he&mdash;They are running at the ring of pleasure, said I, giving
him a prick&mdash;By saint Boogar, and all the saints at the
backside of the door of purgatory, said he&mdash;(making the same
resolution with the abbesse of Andouillets) I'll not go a step
further&mdash;'Tis very well, sir, said I&mdash;I never will argue
a point with one of your family, as long as I live; so leaping off
his back, and kicking off one boot into this ditch, and t'other
into that&mdash;I'll take a dance, said I&mdash;so stay you
here.</p>
<p>A sun-burnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet
me, as I advanced towards them; her hair, which was a dark chesnut
approaching rather to a black, was tied up in a knot, all but a
single tress.</p>
<p>We want a cavalier, said she, holding out both her hands, as if
to offer them&mdash;And a cavalier ye shall have; said I, taking
hold of both of them.</p>
<p>Hadst thou, Nannette, been array'd like a duchesse!</p>
<p>&mdash;But that cursed slit in thy petticoat!</p>
<p>Nannette cared not for it.</p>
<p>We could not have done without you, said she, letting go one
hand, with self-taught politeness, leading me up with the
other.</p>
<p>A lame youth, whom Apollo had recompensed with a pipe, and to
which he had added a tabourin of his own accord, ran sweetly over
the prelude, as he sat upon the bank&mdash;Tie me up this tress
instantly, said Nannette, putting a piece of string into my
hand&mdash;It taught me to forget I was a stranger&mdash;The whole
knot fell down&mdash;We had been seven years acquainted.</p>
<p>The youth struck the note upon the tabourin&mdash;his pipe
followed, and off we bounded&mdash;'the duce take that slit!'</p>
<p>The sister of the youth, who had stolen her voice from heaven,
sung alternately with her brother&mdash;'twas a Gascoigne
roundelay.</p>
<pre>
     Viva la Joia!
     Fidon la Tristessa!
</pre>
<p>The nymphs join'd in unison, and their swains an octave below
them&mdash;</p>
<p>I would have given a crown to have it sew'd up&mdash;Nannette
would not have given a sous&mdash;Viva la joia! was in her
lips&mdash;Viva la joia! was in her eyes. A transient spark of
amity shot across the space betwixt us&mdash;She look'd
amiable!&mdash;Why could I not live, and end my days thus? Just
Disposer of our joys and sorrows, cried I, why could not a man sit
down in the lap of content here&mdash;and dance, and sing, and say
his prayers, and go to heaven with this nut-brown maid?
Capriciously did she bend her head on one side, and dance up
insidious&mdash;Then 'tis time to dance off, quoth I; so changing
only partners and tunes, I danced it away from Lunel to
Montpellier&mdash;from thence to Pescnas, Beziers&mdash;I danced it
along through Narbonne, Carcasson, and Castle Naudairy, till at
last I danced myself into Perdrillo's pavillion, where pulling out
a paper of black lines, that I might go on straight forwards,
without digression or parenthesis, in my uncle Toby's
amours&mdash;</p>
<p>I begun thus&mdash;</p>

piping, fiddling, and dancing to the vintage, and every step that's
taken, the judgment is surprised by the imagination, I defy,

<h2>Chapter 4.XXVI.</h2>
<h3>It is with Love as with Cuckoldom&mdash;</h3>
<p>But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a
thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which, if not
imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live
(whereas the Comparison may be imparted to him any hour in the
day)&mdash;I'll just mention it, and begin in good earnest.</p>
<p>The thing is this.</p>
<p>That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now
in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way
of doing it is the best&mdash;I'm sure it is the most
religious&mdash;for I begin with writing the first
sentence&mdash;and trusting to Almighty God for the second.</p>
<p>'Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of opening
his street-door, and calling in his neighbours and friends, and
kinsfolk, with the devil and all his imps, with their hammers and
engines, &amp;c. only to observe how one sentence of mine follows
another, and how the plan follows the whole.</p>
<p>I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair, with what
confidence, as I grasp the elbow of it, I look up&mdash;catching
the idea, even sometimes before it half way reaches me&mdash;</p>
<p>I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which
heaven intended for another man.</p>
<p>Pope and his Portrait (Vid. Pope's Portrait.) are fools to
me&mdash;no martyr is ever so full of faith or fire&mdash;I wish I
could say of good works too&mdash;but I have no</p>
<pre>
  Zeal or Anger&mdash;or
  Anger or Zeal&mdash;
</pre>
<p>And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same
name&mdash;the errantest Tartuffe, in science&mdash;in
politics&mdash;or in religion, shall never kindle a spark within
me, or have a worse word, or a more unkind greeting, than what he
will read in the next chapter.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bon jour!&mdash;good morrow!&mdash;so you have got your
cloak on betimes!&mdash;but 'tis a cold morning, and you judge the
matter rightly&mdash;'tis better to be well mounted, than go o'
foot&mdash;and obstructions in the glands are dangerous&mdash;And
how goes it with thy concubine&mdash;thy wife,&mdash;and thy little
ones o' both sides? and when did you hear from the old gentleman
and lady&mdash;your sister, aunt, uncle, and cousins&mdash;I hope
they have got better of their colds, coughs, claps, tooth-aches,
fevers, stranguries, sciaticas, swellings, and sore eyes.</p>
<p>&mdash;What a devil of an apothecary! to take so much
blood&mdash;give such a vile
purge&mdash;puke&mdash;poultice&mdash;plaister&mdash;night-draught&mdash;clyster&mdash;blister?&mdash;And
why so many grains of calomel? santa Maria! and such a dose of
opium! peri-clitating, pardi! the whole family of ye, from head to
tail&mdash;By my great-aunt Dinah's old black velvet mask! I think
there is no occasion for it.</p>
<p>Now this being a little bald about the chin, by frequently
putting off and on, before she was got with child by the
coachman&mdash;not one of our family would wear it after. To cover
the Mask afresh, was more than the mask was worth&mdash;and to wear
a mask which was bald, or which could be half seen through, was as
bad as having no mask at all&mdash;</p>
<p>This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that in all
our numerous family, for these four generations, we count no more
than one archbishop, a Welch judge, some three or four aldermen,
and a single mountebank&mdash;</p>

any thing about the matter: this comes, as all the world knows,
from having half a dozen words for one thing; and so long, as what

Nonsense&mdash;no, Madam,&mdash;not there&mdash;I mean at the part
I am now pointing to with my forefinger&mdash;how can we help
ourselves?</p>
<p>Of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever
soliloquized upon this mystic subject, my uncle Toby was the worst
fitted, to have push'd his researches, thro' such a contention of
feelings; and he had infallibly let them all run on, as we do worse
matters, to see what they would turn out&mdash;had not Bridget's
pre-notification of them to Susannah, and Susannah's repeated
manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it necessary for my
uncle Toby to look into the affair.</p>

<p>Why weavers, gardeners, and gladiators&mdash;or a man with a
pined leg (proceeding from some ailment in the foot)&mdash;should
ever have had some tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for
them, are points well and duly settled and accounted for, by
ancient and modern physiologists.</p>
<p>A water-drinker, provided he is a profess'd one, and does it
without fraud or covin, is precisely in the same predicament: not
that, at first sight, there is any consequence, or show of logic in
it, 'That a rill of cold water dribbling through my inward parts,
should light up a torch in my Jenny's&mdash;'</p>
<p>&mdash;The proposition does not strike one; on the contrary, it
seems to run opposite to the natural workings of causes and
effects&mdash;</p>
<p>But it shews the weakness and imbecility of human reason.</p>
<p>&mdash;'And in perfect good health with it?'</p>
<p>&mdash;The most perfect,&mdash;Madam, that friendship herself
could wish me&mdash;</p>
<p>'And drink nothing!&mdash;nothing but water?'</p>

flood-gates of the brain&mdash;see how they give way&mdash;!</p>
<p>In swims Curiosity, beckoning to her damsels to
follow&mdash;they dive into the center of the current&mdash;</p>
<p>Fancy sits musing upon the bank, and with her eyes following the
stream, turns straws and bulrushes into masts and
bow-sprits&mdash;And Desire, with vest held up to the knee in one
hand, snatches at them, as they swim by her, with the
other&mdash;</p>
<p>O ye water drinkers! is it then by this delusive fountain, that
ye have so often governed and turn'd this world about like a
mill-wheel&mdash;grinding the faces of the
impotent&mdash;bepowdering their ribs&mdash;bepeppering their
noses, and changing sometimes even the very frame and face of
nature&mdash;</p>
<p>If I was you, quoth Yorick, I would drink more water,
Eugenius&mdash;And, if I was you, Yorick, replied Eugenius, so
would I.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XXX.</h2>
<p>I wish my uncle Toby had been a water-drinker; for then the
thing had been accounted for, That the first moment Widow Wadman
saw him, she felt something stirring within her in his
favour&mdash;Something!&mdash;something.</p>
<p>&mdash;Something perhaps more than friendship&mdash;less than
love&mdash;something&mdash;no matter what&mdash;no matter
where&mdash;I would not give a single hair off my mule's tail, and
be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain has not many
to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain), to be let
by your worships into the secret&mdash;</p>
<p>But the truth is, my uncle Toby was not a water-drinker; he
drank it neither pure nor mix'd, or any how, or any where, except
fortuitously upon some advanced posts, where better liquor was not
to be had&mdash;or during the time he was under cure; when the
surgeon telling him it would extend the fibres, and bring them
sooner into contact&mdash;my uncle Toby drank it for quietness
sake.</p>
<p>Now as all the world knows, that no effect in nature can be
produced without a cause, and as it is as well known, that my uncle
Toby was neither a weaver&mdash;a gardener, or a
gladiator&mdash;unless as a captain, you will needs have him
one&mdash;but then he was only a captain of foot&mdash;and besides,
the whole is an equivocation&mdash;There is nothing left for us to
suppose, but that my uncle Toby's leg&mdash;but that will avail us
little in the present hypothesis, unless it had proceeded from some
ailment in the foot&mdash;whereas his leg was not emaciated from
any disorder in his foot&mdash;for my uncle Toby's leg was not
emaciated at all. It was a little stiff and awkward, from a total
disuse of it, for the three years he lay confined at my father's
house in town; but it was plump and muscular, and in all other
respects as good and promising a leg as the other.</p>
<p>I declare, I do not recollect any one opinion or passage of my
life, where my understanding was more at a loss to make ends meet,
and torture the chapter I had been writing, to the service of the
chapter following it, than in the present case: one would think I
took a pleasure in running into difficulties of this kind, merely
to make fresh experiments of getting out of 'em&mdash;Inconsiderate
soul that thou art! What! are not the unavoidable distresses with
which, as an author and a man, thou art hemm'd in on every side of
thee&mdash;are they, Tristram, not sufficient, but thou must
entangle thyself still more?</p>
<p>Is it not enough that thou art in debt, and that thou hast ten
cart-loads of thy fifth and sixth volumes (Alluding to the first
edition.) still&mdash;still unsold, and art almost at thy wit's
ends, how to get them off thy hands?</p>
<p>To this hour art thou not tormented with the vile asthma that
thou gattest in skating against the wind in Flanders? and is it but
two months ago, that in a fit of laughter, on seeing a cardinal
make water like a quirister (with both hands) thou brakest a vessel
in thy lungs, whereby, in two hours, thou lost as many quarts of
blood; and hadst thou lost as much more, did not the faculty tell

<p>My uncle Toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat
and precipitation, to take possession of the spot of ground we have
so often spoke of, in order to open their campaign as early as the
rest of the allies; that they had forgot one of the most necessary
articles of the whole affair, it was neither a pioneer's spade, a
pickax, or a shovel&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It was a bed to lie on: so that as Shandy-Hall was at
that time unfurnished; and the little inn where poor Le Fever died,
not yet built; my uncle Toby was constrained to accept of a bed at
Mrs. Wadman's, for a night or two, till corporal Trim (who to the
character of an excellent valet, groom, cook, sempster, surgeon,
and engineer, super-added that of an excellent upholsterer too),
with the help of a carpenter and a couple of taylors, constructed
one in my uncle Toby's house.</p>
<p>A daughter of Eve, for such was widow Wadman, and 'tis all the
character I intend to give of her&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'That she was a perfect woman&mdash;' had better be fifty
leagues off&mdash;or in her warm bed&mdash;or playing with a
case-knife&mdash;or any thing you please&mdash;than make a man the
object of her attention, when the house and all the furniture is
her own.</p>
<p>There is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day-light,
where a woman has a power, physically speaking, of viewing a man in
more lights than one&mdash;but here, for her soul, she can see him
in no light without mixing something of her own goods and chattels
along with him&mdash;till by reiterated acts of such combination,
he gets foisted into her inventory&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And then good night.</p>
<p>But this is not matter of System; for I have delivered that
above&mdash;nor is it matter of Breviary&mdash;for I make no man's
creed but my own&mdash;nor matter of Fact&mdash;at least that I

<p>I do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of
them&mdash;or the strength of their gussets&mdash;but pray do not
night-shifts differ from day-shifts as much in this particular, as
in any thing else in the world; that they so far exceed the others
in length, that when you are laid down in them, they fall almost as
much below the feet, as the day-shifts fall short of them?</p>
<p>Widow Wadman's night-shifts (as was the mode I suppose in King
William's and Queen Anne's reigns) were cut however after this
fashion; and if the fashion is changed (for in Italy they are come
to nothing)&mdash;so much the worse for the public; they were two
Flemish ells and a half in length, so that allowing a moderate
woman two ells, she had half an ell to spare, to do what she would
with.</p>
<p>Now from one little indulgence gained after another, in the many
bleak and decemberley nights of a seven years widow-hood, things
had insensibly come to this pass, and for the two last years had
got establish'd into one of the ordinances of the
bed-chamber&mdash;That as soon as Mrs. Wadman was put to bed, and
had got her legs stretched down to the bottom of it, of which she
always gave Bridget notice&mdash;Bridget, with all suitable
decorum, having first open'd the bed-clothes at the feet, took hold
of the half-ell of cloth we are speaking of, and having gently, and
with both her hands, drawn it downwards to its furthest extension,
and then contracted it again side-long by four or five even plaits,
she took a large corking-pin out of her sleeve, and with the point
directed towards her, pinn'd the plaits all fast together a little
above the hem; which done, she tuck'd all in tight at the feet, and
wish'd her mistress a good night.</p>
<p>This was constant, and without any other variation than this;
that on shivering and tempestuous nights, when Bridget untuck'd the
feet of the bed, &amp;c. to do this&mdash;she consulted no
thermometer but that of her own passions; and so performed it
standing&mdash;kneeling&mdash;or squatting, according to the
different degrees of faith, hope, and charity, she was in, and bore
towards her mistress that night. In every other respect, the
etiquette was sacred, and might have vied with the most mechanical
one of the most inflexible bed-chamber in Christendom.</p>
<p>The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle
Toby up stairs, which was about ten&mdash;Mrs. Wadman threw herself
into her arm-chair, and crossing her left knee with her right,
which formed a resting-place for her elbow, she reclin'd her cheek
upon the palm of her hand, and leaning forwards, ruminated till
midnight upon both sides of the question.</p>
<p>The second night she went to her bureau, and having ordered
Bridget to bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them
upon the table, she took out her marriage-settlement, and read it
over with great devotion: and the third night (which was the last
of my uncle Toby's stay) when Bridget had pull'd down the
night-shift, and was assaying to stick in the corking
pin&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;With a kick of both heels at once, but at the same time
the most natural kick that could be kick'd in her
situation&mdash;for supposing......... to be the sun in its
meridian, it was a north-east kick&mdash;she kick'd the pin out of
her fingers&mdash;the etiquette which hung upon it, down&mdash;down
it fell to the ground, and was shiver'd into a thousand atoms.</p>
<p>From all which it was plain that widow Wadman was in love with
my uncle Toby.</p>

<p>My uncle Toby's head at that time was full of other matters, so
that it was not till the demolition of Dunkirk, when all the other
civilities of Europe were settled, that he found leisure to return
this.</p>
<p>This made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my
uncle Toby&mdash;but with respect to Mrs. Wadman, a
vacancy)&mdash;of almost eleven years. But in all cases of this
nature, as it is the second blow, happen at what distance of time
it will, which makes the fray&mdash;I chuse for that reason to call
these the amours of my uncle Toby with Mrs. Wadman, rather than the
amours of Mrs. Wadman with my uncle Toby.</p>

<p>It is not like the affair of an old hat cock'd&mdash;and a

<p>Now as widow Wadman did love my uncle Toby&mdash;and my uncle
Toby did not love widow Wadman, there was nothing for widow Wadman
to do, but to go on and love my uncle Toby&mdash;or let it
alone.</p>
<p>Widow Wadman would do neither the one or the other.</p>
<p>&mdash;Gracious heaven!&mdash;but I forget I am a little of her
temper myself; for whenever it so falls out, which it sometimes
does about the equinoxes, that an earthly goddess is so much this,
and that, and t'other, that I cannot eat my breakfast for
her&mdash;and that she careth not three halfpence whether I eat my
breakfast or no&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Curse on her! and so I send her to Tartary, and from
Tartary to Terra del Fuogo, and so on to the devil: in short, there
is not an infernal nitch where I do not take her divinityship and
stick it.</p>
<p>But as the heart is tender, and the passions in these tides ebb
and flow ten times in a minute, I instantly bring her back again;
and as I do all things in extremes, I place her in the very center
of the milky-way&mdash;</p>
<p>Brightest of stars! thou wilt shed thy influence upon some
one&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The duce take her and her influence too&mdash;for at that
word I lose all patience&mdash;much good may it do him!&mdash;By
all that is hirsute and gashly! I cry, taking off my furr'd cap,
and twisting it round my finger&mdash;I would not give sixpence for
a dozen such!</p>
<p>&mdash;But 'tis an excellent cap too (putting it upon my head,
and pressing it close to my ears)&mdash;and warm&mdash;and soft;

<h2>Chapter 4.XXXVIII.</h2>
<p>The Fates, who certainly all fore-knew of these amours of widow
Wadman and my uncle Toby, had, from the first creation of matter
and motion (and with more courtesy than they usually do things of
this kind), established such a chain of causes and effects hanging
so fast to one another, that it was scarce possible for my uncle
Toby to have dwelt in any other house in the world, or to have
occupied any other garden in Christendom, but the very house and
garden which join'd and laid parallel to Mrs. Wadman's; this, with
the advantage of a thickset arbour in Mrs. Wadman's garden, but
planted in the hedge-row of my uncle Toby's, put all the occasions
into her hands which Love-militancy wanted; she could observe my
uncle Toby's motions, and was mistress likewise of his councils of
war; and as his unsuspecting heart had given leave to the corporal,
through the mediation of Bridget, to make her a wicker-gate of
communication to enlarge her walks, it enabled her to carry on her
approaches to the very door of the sentry-box; and sometimes out of
gratitude, to make an attack, and endeavour to blow my uncle Toby
up in the very sentry-box itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XXXIX.</h2>
<p>It is a great pity&mdash;but 'tis certain from every day's
observation of man, that he may be set on fire like a candle, at
either end&mdash;provided there is a sufficient wick standing out;
if there is not&mdash;there's an end of the affair; and if there
is&mdash;by lighting it at the bottom, as the flame in that case
has the misfortune generally to put out itself&mdash;there's an end
of the affair again.</p>
<p>For my part, could I always have the ordering of it which way I
would be burnt myself&mdash;for I cannot bear the thoughts of being
burnt like a beast&mdash;I would oblige a housewife constantly to
light me at the top; for then I should burn down decently to the
socket; that is, from my head to my heart, from my heart to my
liver, from my liver to my bowels, and so on by the meseraick veins
and arteries, through all the turns and lateral insertions of the
intestines and their tunicles to the blind gut&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I beseech you, doctor Slop, quoth my uncle Toby,
interrupting him as he mentioned the blind gut, in a discourse with
my father the night my mother was brought to bed of me&mdash;I
beseech you, quoth my uncle Toby, to tell me which is the blind
gut; for, old as I am, I vow I do not know to this day where it
lies.</p>
<p>The blind gut, answered doctor Slop, lies betwixt the Ilion and
Colon&mdash;</p>
<p>In a man? said my father.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis precisely the same, cried doctor Slop, in a
woman.&mdash;</p>
<p>That's more than I know; quoth my father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XL.</h2>
<p>&mdash;And so to make sure of both systems, Mrs. Wadman
predetermined to light my uncle Toby neither at this end or that;
but, like a prodigal's candle, to light him, if possible, at both
ends at once.</p>
<p>Now, through all the lumber rooms of military furniture,
including both of horse and foot, from the great arsenal of Venice
to the Tower of London (exclusive), if Mrs. Wadman had been
rummaging for seven years together, and with Bridget to help her,
she could not have found any one blind or mantelet so fit for her
purpose, as that which the expediency of my uncle Toby's affairs
had fix'd up ready to her hands.</p>
<p>I believe I have not told you&mdash;but I don't
know&mdash;possibly I have&mdash;be it as it will, 'tis one of the
number of those many things, which a man had better do over again,
than dispute about it&mdash;That whatever town or fortress the
corporal was at work upon, during the course of their campaign, my
uncle Toby always took care, on the inside of his sentry-box, which
was towards his left hand, to have a plan of the place, fasten'd up
with two or three pins at the top, but loose at the bottom, for the
conveniency of holding it up to the eye, &amp;c...as occasions
required; so that when an attack was resolved upon, Mrs. Wadman had
nothing more to do, when she had got advanced to the door of the
sentry-box, but to extend her right hand; and edging in her left
foot at the same movement, to take hold of the map or plan, or
upright, or whatever it was, and with out-stretched neck meeting it
half way,&mdash;to advance it towards her; on which my uncle Toby's
passions were sure to catch fire&mdash;for he would instantly take
hold of the other corner of the map in his left hand, and with the
end of his pipe in the other, begin an explanation.</p>
<p>When the attack was advanced to this point;&mdash;the world will
naturally enter into the reasons of Mrs. Wadman's next stroke of
generalship&mdash;which was, to take my uncle Toby's tobacco-pipe
out of his hand as soon as she possibly could; which, under one
pretence or other, but generally that of pointing more distinctly
at some redoubt or breastwork in the map, she would effect before
my uncle Toby (poor soul!) had well march'd above half a dozen
toises with it.</p>
<p>&mdash;It obliged my uncle Toby to make use of his
forefinger.</p>
<p>The difference it made in the attack was this; That in going
upon it, as in the first case, with the end of her fore-finger
against the end of my uncle Toby's tobacco-pipe, she might have
travelled with it, along the lines, from Dan to Beersheba, had my
uncle Toby's lines reach'd so far, without any effect: For as there
was no arterial or vital heat in the end of the tobacco-pipe, it
could excite no sentiment&mdash;it could neither give fire by
pulsation&mdash;or receive it by sympathy&mdash;'twas nothing but
smoke.</p>
<p>Whereas, in following my uncle Toby's forefinger with hers,
close thro' all the little turns and indentings of his
works&mdash;pressing sometimes against the side of it&mdash;then
treading upon its nail&mdash;then tripping it up&mdash;then
touching it here&mdash;then there, and so on&mdash;it set something
at least in motion.</p>
<p>This, tho' slight skirmishing, and at a distance from the main
body, yet drew on the rest; for here, the map usually falling with
the back of it, close to the side of the sentry-box, my uncle Toby,
in the simplicity of his soul, would lay his hand flat upon it, in
order to go on with his explanation; and Mrs. Wadman, by a
manoeuvre as quick as thought, would as certainly place her's close
beside it; this at once opened a communication, large enough for
any sentiment to pass or re-pass, which a person skill'd in the
elementary and practical part of love-making, has occasion
for&mdash;</p>
<p>By bringing up her forefinger parallel (as before) to my uncle
Toby's&mdash;it unavoidably brought the thumb into action&mdash;and
the forefinger and thumb being once engaged, as naturally brought
in the whole hand. Thine, dear uncle Toby! was never now in 'ts
right place&mdash;Mrs. Wadman had it ever to take up, or, with the
gentlest pushings, protrusions, and equivocal compressions, that a
hand to be removed is capable of receiving&mdash;to get it press'd
a hair breadth of one side out of her way.</p>
<p>Whilst this was doing, how could she forget to make him
sensible, that it was her leg (and no one's else) at the bottom of
the sentry-box, which slightly press'd against the calf of
his&mdash;So that my uncle Toby being thus attack'd and sore push'd
on both his wings&mdash;was it a wonder, if now and then, it put
his centre into disorder?&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The duce take it! said my uncle Toby.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLI.</h2>
<p>These attacks of Mrs. Wadman, you will readily conceive to be of
different kinds; varying from each other, like the attacks which
history is full of, and from the same reasons. A general looker-on
would scarce allow them to be attacks at all&mdash;or if he did,
would confound them all together&mdash;but I write not to them: it
will be time enough to be a little more exact in my descriptions of
them, as I come up to them, which will not be for some chapters;
having nothing more to add in this, but that in a bundle of
original papers and drawings which my father took care to roll up
by themselves, there is a plan of Bouchain in perfect preservation
(and shall be kept so, whilst I have power to preserve any thing),
upon the lower corner of which, on the right hand side, there is
still remaining the marks of a snuffy finger and thumb, which there
is all the reason in the world to imagine, were Mrs. Wadman's; for
the opposite side of the margin, which I suppose to have been my
uncle Toby's, is absolutely clean: This seems an authenticated
record of one of these attacks; for there are vestigia of the two
punctures partly grown up, but still visible on the opposite corner
of the map, which are unquestionably the very holes, through which
it has been pricked up in the sentry-box&mdash;</p>
<p>By all that is priestly! I value this precious relick, with its
stigmata and pricks, more than all the relicks of the Romish
church&mdash;always excepting, when I am writing upon these
matters, the pricks which entered the flesh of St. Radagunda in the
desert, which in your road from Fesse to Cluny, the nuns of that
name will shew you for love.</p>

<p>I think, an' please your honour, quoth Trim, the fortifications
are quite destroyed&mdash;and the bason is upon a level with the
mole&mdash;I think so too; replied my uncle Toby with a sigh half
suppress'd&mdash;but step into the parlour, Trim, for the
stipulation&mdash;it lies upon the table.</p>
<p>It has lain there these six weeks, replied the corporal, till
this very morning that the old woman kindled the fire with
it&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Then, said my uncle Toby, there is no further occasion
for our services. The more, an' please your honour, the pity, said
the corporal; in uttering which he cast his spade into the
wheel-barrow, which was beside him, with an air the most expressive
of disconsolation that can be imagined, and was heavily turning
about to look for his pickax, his pioneer's shovel, his picquets,
and other little military stores, in order to carry them off the
field&mdash;when a heigh-ho! from the sentry-box, which being made
of thin slit deal, reverberated the sound more sorrowfully to his
ear, forbad him.</p>
<p>&mdash;No; said the corporal to himself, I'll do it before his
honour rises to-morrow morning; so taking his spade out of the
wheel-barrow again, with a little earth in it, as if to level
something at the foot of the glacis&mdash;but with a real intent to
approach nearer to his master, in order to divert him&mdash;he
loosen'd a sod or two&mdash;pared their edges with his spade, and
having given them a gentle blow or two with the back of it, he sat
himself down close by my uncle Toby's feet and began as
follows.</p>

<p>It was a thousand pities&mdash;though I believe, an' please your
honour, I am going to say but a foolish kind of a thing for a
soldier&mdash;</p>
<p>A soldier, cried my uncle Toby, interrupting the corporal, is no
more exempt from saying a foolish thing, Trim, than a man of
letters&mdash;But not so often, an' please your honour, replied the
corporal&mdash;my uncle Toby gave a nod.</p>
<p>It was a thousand pities then, said the corporal, casting his
eye upon Dunkirk, and the mole, as Servius Sulpicius, in returning
out of Asia (when he sailed from Aegina towards Megara), did upon
Corinth and Pyreus&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'It was a thousand pities, an' please your honour, to
destroy these works&mdash;and a thousand pities to have let them
stood.'&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Thou art right, Trim, in both cases; said my uncle
Toby.&mdash;This, continued the corporal, is the reason, that from
the beginning of their demolition to the end&mdash;I have never
once whistled, or sung, or laugh'd, or cry'd, or talk'd of past
done deeds, or told your honour one story good or bad&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Thou hast many excellencies, Trim, said my uncle Toby,
and I hold it not the least of them, as thou happenest to be a
story-teller, that of the number thou hast told me, either to amuse
me in my painful hours, or divert me in my grave ones&mdash;thou
hast seldom told me a bad one&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Because, an' please your honour, except one of a King of
Bohemia and his seven castles,&mdash;they are all true; for they
are about myself&mdash;</p>
<p>I do not like the subject the worse, Trim, said my uncle Toby,
on that score: But prithee what is this story? thou hast excited my
curiosity.</p>
<p>I'll tell it your honour, quoth the corporal,
directly&mdash;Provided, said my uncle Toby, looking earnestly
towards Dunkirk and the mole again&mdash;provided it is not a merry
one; to such, Trim, a man should ever bring one half of the
entertainment along with him; and the disposition I am in at
present would wrong both thee, Trim, and thy story&mdash;It is not
a merry one by any means, replied the corporal&mdash;Nor would I
have it altogether a grave one, added my uncle Toby&mdash;It is
neither the one nor the other, replied the corporal, but will suit
your honour exactly&mdash;Then I'll thank thee for it with all my
heart, cried my uncle Toby; so prithee begin it, Trim.</p>
<p>The corporal made his reverence; and though it is not so easy a
matter as the world imagines, to pull off a lank Montero-cap with
grace&mdash;or a whit less difficult, in my conceptions, when a man
is sitting squat upon the ground, to make a bow so teeming with
respect as the corporal was wont; yet by suffering the palm of his
right hand, which was towards his master, to slip backwards upon
the grass, a little beyond his body, in order to allow it the
greater sweep&mdash;and by an unforced compression, at the same
time, of his cap with the thumb and the two forefingers of his
left, by which the diameter of the cap became reduced, so that it
might be said, rather to be insensibly squeez'd&mdash;than pull'd
off with a flatus&mdash;the corporal acquitted himself of both in a
better manner than the posture of his affairs promised; and having
hemmed twice, to find in what key his story would best go, and best
suit his master's humour,&mdash;he exchanged a single look of
kindness with him, and set off thus.</p>
<p>The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles.</p>
<p>There was a certain king of Bo...he&mdash;As the corporal was
entering the confines of Bohemia, my uncle Toby obliged him to halt
for a single moment; he had set out bare-headed, having, since he
pull'd off his Montero-cap in the latter end of the last chapter,
left it lying beside him on the ground.</p>
<p>&mdash;The eye of Goodness espieth all things&mdash;so that
before the corporal had well got through the first five words of
his story, had my uncle Toby twice touch'd his Montero-cap with the
end of his cane, interrogatively&mdash;as much as to say, Why don't
you put it on, Trim? Trim took it up with the most respectful
slowness, and casting a glance of humiliation as he did it, upon
the embroidery of the fore-part, which being dismally tarnish'd and
fray'd moreover in some of the principal leaves and boldest parts
of the pattern, he lay'd it down again between his two feet, in
order to moralize upon the subject.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis every word of it but too true, cried my uncle Toby,
that thou art about to observe&mdash;</p>
<p>'Nothing in this world, Trim, is made to last for ever.'</p>
<p>&mdash;But when tokens, dear Tom, of thy love and remembrance
wear out, said Trim, what shall we say?</p>
<p>There is no occasion, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, to say any
thing else; and was a man to puzzle his brains till Doom's day, I
believe, Trim, it would be impossible.</p>
<p>The corporal, perceiving my uncle Toby was in the right, and
that it would be in vain for the wit of man to think of extracting
a purer moral from his cap, without further attempting it, he put
it on; and passing his hand across his forehead to rub out a
pensive wrinkle, which the text and the doctrine between them had
engender'd, he return'd, with the same look and tone of voice, to
his story of the king of Bohemia and his seven castles.</p>
<p>The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles,
Continued.</p>
<p>There was a certain king of Bohemia, but in whose reign, except
his own, I am not able to inform your honour&mdash;</p>
<p>I do not desire it of thee, Trim, by any means, cried my uncle
Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;It was a little before the time, an' please your honour,
when giants were beginning to leave off breeding:&mdash;but in what
year of our Lord that was&mdash;</p>
<p>I would not give a halfpenny to know, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>&mdash;Only, an' please your honour, it makes a story look the
better in the face&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis thy own, Trim, so ornament it after thy own fashion;
and take any date, continued my uncle Toby, looking pleasantly upon
him&mdash;take any date in the whole world thou chusest, and put it
to&mdash;thou art heartily welcome&mdash;</p>
<p>The corporal bowed; for of every century, and of every year of
that century, from the first creation of the world down to Noah's
flood; and from Noah's flood to the birth of Abraham; through all
the pilgrimages of the patriarchs, to the departure of the
Israelites out of Egypt&mdash;and throughout all the Dynasties,
Olympiads, Urbeconditas, and other memorable epochas of the
different nations of the world, down to the coming of Christ, and
from thence to the very moment in which the corporal was telling
his story&mdash;had my uncle Toby subjected this vast empire of
time and all its abysses at his feet; but as Modesty scarce touches
with a finger what Liberality offers her with both hands
open&mdash;the corporal contented himself with the very worst year
of the whole bunch; which, to prevent your honours of the Majority
and Minority from tearing the very flesh off your bones in
contestation, 'Whether that year is not always the last cast-year
of the last cast-almanack'&mdash;I tell you plainly it was; but
from a different reason than you wot of&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It was the year next him&mdash;which being the year of
our Lord seventeen hundred and twelve, when the Duke of Ormond was
playing the devil in Flanders&mdash;the corporal took it, and set
out with it afresh on his expedition to Bohemia.</p>
<p>The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles,
Continued.</p>
<p>In the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twelve,
there was, an' please your honour&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;To tell thee truly, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, any other
date would have pleased me much better, not only on account of the
sad stain upon our history that year, in marching off our troops,
and refusing to cover the siege of Quesnoi, though Fagel was
carrying on the works with such incredible vigour&mdash;but
likewise on the score, Trim, of thy own story; because if there
are&mdash;and which, from what thou hast dropt, I partly suspect to
be the fact&mdash;if there are giants in it&mdash;</p>
<p>There is but one, an' please your honour&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis as bad as twenty, replied my uncle Toby&mdash;thou
should'st have carried him back some seven or eight hundred years
out of harm's way, both of critics and other people: and therefore
I would advise thee, if ever thou tellest it again&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;If I live, an' please your honour, but once to get
through it, I will never tell it again, quoth Trim, either to man,
woman, or child&mdash;Poo&mdash;poo! said my uncle Toby&mdash;but
with accents of such sweet encouragement did he utter it, that the
corporal went on with his story with more alacrity than ever.</p>
<p>The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles,
Continued.</p>
<p>There was, an' please your honour, said the corporal, raising
his voice and rubbing the palms of his two hands cheerily together
as he begun, a certain king of Bohemia&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Leave out the date entirely, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,
leaning forwards, and laying his hand gently upon the corporal's
shoulder to temper the interruption&mdash;leave it out entirely,
Trim; a story passes very well without these niceties, unless one
is pretty sure of 'em&mdash;Sure of 'em! said the corporal, shaking
his head&mdash;</p>
<p>Right; answered my uncle Toby, it is not easy, Trim, for one,
bred up as thou and I have been to arms, who seldom looks further
forward than to the end of his musket, or backwards beyond his
knapsack, to know much about this matter&mdash;God bless your
honour! said the corporal, won by the manner of my uncle Toby's
reasoning, as much as by the reasoning itself, he has something
else to do; if not on action, or a march, or upon duty in his
garrison&mdash;he has his firelock, an' please your honour, to
furbish&mdash;his accoutrements to take care of&mdash;his
regimentals to mend&mdash;himself to shave and keep clean, so as to
appear always like what he is upon the parade; what business, added
the corporal triumphantly, has a soldier, an' please your honour,
to know any thing at all of geography?</p>
<p>&mdash;Thou would'st have said chronology, Trim, said my uncle
Toby; for as for geography, 'tis of absolute use to him; he must be
acquainted intimately with every country and its boundaries where
his profession carries him; he should know every town and city, and
village and hamlet, with the canals, the roads, and hollow ways
which lead up to them; there is not a river or a rivulet he passes,
Trim, but he should be able at first sight to tell thee what is its
name&mdash;in what mountains it takes its rise&mdash;what is its
course&mdash;how far it is navigable&mdash;where
fordable&mdash;where not; he should know the fertility of every
valley, as well as the hind who ploughs it; and be able to
describe, or, if it is required, to give thee an exact map of all
the plains and defiles, the forts, the acclivities, the woods and
morasses, thro' and by which his army is to march; he should know
their produce, their plants, their minerals, their waters, their
animals, their seasons, their climates, their heats and cold, their
inhabitants, their customs, their language, their policy, and even
their religion.</p>
<p>Is it else to be conceived, corporal, continued my uncle Toby,
rising up in his sentry-box, as he began to warm in this part of
his discourse&mdash;how Marlborough could have marched his army
from the banks of the Maes to Belburg; from Belburg to
Kerpenord&mdash;(here the corporal could sit no longer) from
Kerpenord, Trim, to Kalsaken; from Kalsaken to Newdorf; from
Newdorf to Landenbourg; from Landenbourg to Mildenheim; from
Mildenheim to Elchingen; from Elchingen to Gingen; from Gingen to
Balmerchoffen; from Balmerchoffen to Skellenburg, where he broke in
upon the enemy's works; forced his passage over the Danube; cross'd
the Lech&mdash;push'd on his troops into the heart of the empire,
marching at the head of them through Fribourg, Hokenwert, and
Schonevelt, to the plains of Blenheim and Hochstet?&mdash;Great as
he was, corporal, he could not have advanced a step, or made one
single day's march without the aids of Geography.&mdash;As for
Chronology, I own, Trim, continued my uncle Toby, sitting down
again coolly in his sentry-box, that of all others, it seems a
science which the soldier might best spare, was it not for the
lights which that science must one day give him, in determining the
invention of powder; the furious execution of which, renversing
every thing like thunder before it, has become a new aera to us of
military improvements, changing so totally the nature of attacks
and defences both by sea and land, and awakening so much art and
skill in doing it, that the world cannot be too exact in
ascertaining the precise time of its discovery, or too inquisitive
in knowing what great man was the discoverer, and what occasions
gave birth to it.</p>
<p>I am far from controverting, continued my uncle Toby, what
historians agree in, that in the year of our Lord 1380, under the
reign of Wencelaus, son of Charles the Fourth&mdash;a certain
priest, whose name was Schwartz, shew'd the use of powder to the
Venetians, in their wars against the Genoese; but 'tis certain he
was not the first; because if we are to believe Don Pedro, the
bishop of Leon&mdash;How came priests and bishops, an' please your
honour, to trouble their heads so much about gun-powder? God knows,
said my uncle Toby&mdash;his providence brings good out of every
thing&mdash;and he avers, in his chronicle of King Alphonsus, who
reduced Toledo, That in the year 1343, which was full thirty-seven
years before that time, the secret of powder was well known, and
employed with success, both by Moors and Christians, not only in
their sea-combats, at that period, but in many of their most
memorable sieges in Spain and Barbary&mdash;And all the world
knows, that Friar Bacon had wrote expressly about it, and had
generously given the world a receipt to make it by, above a hundred
and fifty years before even Schwartz was born&mdash;And that the
Chinese, added my uncle Toby, embarrass us, and all accounts of it,
still more, by boasting of the invention some hundreds of years
even before him&mdash;</p>
<p>They are a pack of liars, I believe, cried Trim&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;They are somehow or other deceived, said my uncle Toby,
in this matter, as is plain to me from the present miserable state
of military architecture amongst them; which consists of nothing
more than a fosse with a brick wall without flanks&mdash;and for
what they gave us as a bastion at each angle of it, 'tis so
barbarously constructed, that it looks for all the world&mdash;Like
one of my seven castles, an' please your honour, quoth Trim.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby, tho' in the utmost distress for a comparison,
most courteously refused Trim's offer&mdash;till Trim telling him,
he had half a dozen more in Bohemia, which he knew not how to get
off his hands&mdash;my uncle Toby was so touch'd with the
pleasantry of heart of the corporal&mdash;that he discontinued his
dissertation upon gun-powder&mdash;and begged the corporal
forthwith to go on with his story of the King of Bohemia and his
seven castles.</p>
<p>The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles,
Continued.</p>
<p>This unfortunate King of Bohemia, said Trim,&mdash;Was he
unfortunate, then? cried my uncle Toby, for he had been so wrapt up
in his dissertation upon gun-powder, and other military affairs,
that tho' he had desired the corporal to go on, yet the many
interruptions he had given, dwelt not so strong upon his fancy as
to account for the epithet&mdash;Was he unfortunate, then, Trim?
said my uncle Toby, pathetically&mdash;The corporal, wishing first
the word and all its synonimas at the devil, forthwith began to run
back in his mind, the principal events in the King of Bohemia's
story; from every one of which, it appearing that he was the most
fortunate man that ever existed in the world&mdash;it put the
corporal to a stand: for not caring to retract his
epithet&mdash;and less to explain it&mdash;and least of all, to
twist his tale (like men of lore) to serve a system&mdash;he looked
up in my uncle Toby's face for assistance&mdash;but seeing it was
the very thing my uncle Toby sat in expectation of
himself&mdash;after a hum and a haw, he went on&mdash;</p>
<p>The King of Bohemia, an' please your honour, replied the
corporal, was unfortunate, as thus&mdash;That taking great pleasure
and delight in navigation and all sort of sea affairs&mdash;and
there happening throughout the whole kingdom of Bohemia, to be no
sea-port town whatever&mdash;</p>
<p>How the duce should there&mdash;Trim? cried my uncle Toby; for
Bohemia being totally inland, it could have happen'd no
otherwise&mdash;It might, said Trim, if it had pleased
God&mdash;</p>
<p>My uncle Toby never spoke of the being and natural attributes of
God, but with diffidence and hesitation&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I believe not, replied my uncle Toby, after some
pause&mdash;for being inland, as I said, and having Silesia and
Moravia to the east; Lusatia and Upper Saxony to the north;
Franconia to the west; and Bavaria to the south; Bohemia could not
have been propell'd to the sea without ceasing to be
Bohemia&mdash;nor could the sea, on the other hand, have come up to
Bohemia, without overflowing a great part of Germany, and
destroying millions of unfortunate inhabitants who could make no
defence against it&mdash;Scandalous! cried Trim&mdash;Which would
bespeak, added my uncle Toby, mildly, such a want of compassion in
him who is the father of it&mdash;that, I think, Trim&mdash;the
thing could have happen'd no way.</p>
<p>The corporal made the bow of unfeign'd conviction; and went
on.</p>
<p>Now the King of Bohemia with his queen and courtiers happening
one fine summer's evening to walk out&mdash;Aye! there the word
happening is right, Trim, cried my uncle Toby; for the King of
Bohemia and his queen might have walk'd out or let it
alone:&mdash;'twas a matter of contingency, which might happen, or
not, just as chance ordered it.</p>
<p>King William was of an opinion, an' please your honour, quoth
Trim, that every thing was predestined for us in this world;
insomuch, that he would often say to his soldiers, that 'every ball
had its billet.' He was a great man, said my uncle Toby&mdash;And I
believe, continued Trim, to this day, that the shot which disabled
me at the battle of Landen, was pointed at my knee for no other
purpose, but to take me out of his service, and place me in your
honour's, where I should be taken so much better care of in my old
age&mdash;It shall never, Trim, be construed otherwise, said my
uncle Toby.</p>
<p>The heart, both of the master and the man, were alike subject to
sudden over-flowings;&mdash;a short silence ensued.</p>
<p>Besides, said the corporal, resuming the discourse&mdash;but in
a gayer accent&mdash;if it had not been for that single shot, I had
never, 'an please your honour, been in love&mdash;</p>
<p>So, thou wast once in love, Trim! said my uncle Toby,
smiling&mdash;</p>
<p>Souse! replied the corporal&mdash;over head and ears! an' please
your honour. Prithee when? where?&mdash;and how came it to
pass?&mdash;I never heard one word of it before; quoth my uncle
Toby:&mdash;I dare say, answered Trim, that every drummer and
serjeant's son in the regiment knew of it&mdash;It's high time I
should&mdash;said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>Your honour remembers with concern, said the corporal, the total
rout and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of Landen;
every one was left to shift for himself; and if it had not been for
the regiments of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, which covered the
retreat over the bridge Neerspeeken, the king himself could scarce
have gained it&mdash;he was press'd hard, as your honour knows, on
every side of him&mdash;</p>
<p>Gallant mortal! cried my uncle Toby, caught up with
enthusiasm&mdash;this moment, now that all is lost, I see him
galloping across me, corporal, to the left, to bring up the remains
of the English horse along with him to support the right, and tear
the laurel from Luxembourg's brows, if yet 'tis possible&mdash;I
see him with the knot of his scarfe just shot off, infusing fresh
spirits into poor Galway's regiment&mdash;riding along the
line&mdash;then wheeling about, and charging Conti at the head of
it&mdash;Brave, brave, by heaven! cried my uncle Toby&mdash;he
deserves a crown&mdash;As richly, as a thief a halter; shouted
Trim.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby knew the corporal's loyalty;&mdash;otherwise the
comparison was not at all to his mind&mdash;it did not altogether
strike the corporal's fancy when he had made it&mdash;but it could
not be recall'd&mdash;so he had nothing to do, but proceed.</p>
<p>As the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to
think of any thing but his own safety&mdash;Though Talmash, said my
uncle Toby, brought off the foot with great prudence&mdash;But I
was left upon the field, said the corporal. Thou wast so; poor
fellow! replied my uncle Toby&mdash;So that it was noon the next
day, continued the corporal, before I was exchanged, and put into a
cart with thirteen or fourteen more, in order to be convey'd to our
hospital.</p>
<p>There is no part of the body, an' please your honour, where a
wound occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the
knee&mdash;</p>
<p>Except the groin; said my uncle Toby. An' please your honour,
replied the corporal, the knee, in my opinion, must certainly be
the most acute, there being so many tendons and what-d'ye-call-'ems
all about it.</p>
<p>It is for that reason, quoth my uncle Toby, that the groin is
infinitely more sensible&mdash;there being not only as many tendons
and what-d'ye-call-'ems (for I know their names as little as thou
dost)&mdash;about it&mdash;but moreover ...&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wadman, who had been all the time in her
arbour&mdash;instantly stopp'd her breath&mdash;unpinn'd her mob at
the chin, and stood upon one leg&mdash;</p>
<p>The dispute was maintained with amicable and equal force betwixt
my uncle Toby and Trim for some time; till Trim at length
recollecting that he had often cried at his master's sufferings,
but never shed a tear at his own&mdash;was for giving up the point,
which my uncle Toby would not allow&mdash;'Tis a proof of nothing,
Trim, said he, but the generosity of thy temper&mdash;</p>
<p>So that whether the pain of a wound in the groin (caeteris
paribus) is greater than the pain of a wound in the
knee&mdash;or</p>
<p>Whether the pain of a wound in the knee is not greater than the
pain of a wound in the groin&mdash;are points which to this day
remain unsettled.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLIV.</h2>
<p>The anguish of my knee, continued the corporal, was excessive in
itself; and the uneasiness of the cart, with the roughness of the
roads, which were terribly cut up&mdash;making bad still
worse&mdash;every step was death to me: so that with the loss of
blood, and the want of care-taking of me, and a fever I felt coming
on besides&mdash;(Poor soul! said my uncle Toby)&mdash;all
together, an' please your honour, was more than I could
sustain.</p>
<p>I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasant's
house, where our cart, which was the last of the line, had halted;
they had help'd me in, and the young woman had taken a cordial out
of her pocket and dropp'd it upon some sugar, and seeing it had
cheer'd me, she had given it me a second and a third time&mdash;So
I was telling her, an' please your honour, the anguish I was in,
and was saying it was so intolerable to me, that I had much rather
lie down upon the bed, turning my face towards one which was in the
corner of the room&mdash;and die, than go on&mdash;when, upon her
attempting to lead me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was a
good soul! as your honour, said the corporal, wiping his eyes, will
hear.</p>
<p>I thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>'Tis the most serious thing, an' please your honour (sometimes),
that is in the world.</p>
<p>By the persuasion of the young woman, continued the corporal,
the cart with the wounded men set off without me: she had assured
them I should expire immediately if I was put into the cart. So
when I came to myself&mdash;I found myself in a still quiet
cottage, with no one but the young woman, and the peasant and his
wife. I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room, with my
wounded leg upon a chair, and the young woman beside me, holding
the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my nose with
one hand, and rubbing my temples with the other.</p>
<p>I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant (for it was
no inn)&mdash;so had offer'd her a little purse with eighteen
florins, which my poor brother Tom (here Trim wip'd his eyes) had
sent me as a token, by a recruit, just before he set out for
Lisbon&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I never told your honour that piteous story
yet&mdash;here Trim wiped his eyes a third time.</p>
<p>The young woman call'd the old man and his wife into the room,
to shew them the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed and
what little necessaries I should want, till I should be in a
condition to be got to the hospital&mdash;Come then! said she,
tying up the little purse&mdash;I'll be your banker&mdash;but as
that office alone will not keep me employ'd, I'll be your nurse
too.</p>
<p>I thought by her manner of speaking this, as well as by her
dress, which I then began to consider more attentively&mdash;that
the young woman could not be the daughter of the peasant.</p>
<p>She was in black down to her toes, with her hair conceal'd under
a cambric border, laid close to her forehead: she was one of those
kind of nuns, an' please your honour, of which, your honour knows,
there are a good many in Flanders, which they let go loose&mdash;By
thy description, Trim, said my uncle Toby, I dare say she was a
young Beguine, of which there are none to be found any where but in
the Spanish Netherlands&mdash;except at Amsterdam&mdash;they differ
from nuns in this, that they can quit their cloister if they choose
to marry; they visit and take care of the sick by
profession&mdash;I had rather, for my own part, they did it out of
good-nature.</p>
<p>&mdash;She often told me, quoth Trim, she did it for the love of
Christ&mdash;I did not like it.&mdash;I believe, Trim, we are both
wrong, said my uncle Toby&mdash;we'll ask Mr. Yorick about it
to-night at my brother Shandy's&mdash;so put me in mind; added my
uncle Toby.</p>
<p>The young Beguine, continued the corporal, had scarce given
herself time to tell me 'she would be my nurse,' when she hastily
turned about to begin the office of one, and prepare something for
me&mdash;and in a short time&mdash;though I thought it a long
one&mdash;she came back with flannels, &amp;c. &amp;c. and having
fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours, &amp;c. and made me
a thin bason of gruel for my supper&mdash;she wish'd me rest, and
promised to be with me early in the morning.&mdash;She wish'd me,
an' please your honour, what was not to be had. My fever ran very
high that night&mdash;her figure made sad disturbance within
me&mdash;I was every moment cutting the world in two&mdash;to give
her half of it&mdash;and every moment was I crying, That I had
nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with
her&mdash;The whole night long was the fair Beguine, like an angel,
close by my bed-side, holding back my curtain and offering me
cordials&mdash;and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming
there at the hour promised, and giving them in reality. In truth,
she was scarce ever from me; and so accustomed was I to receive
life from her hands, that my heart sickened, and I lost colour when
she left the room: and yet, continued the corporal (making one of
the strangest reflections upon it in the world)&mdash;&mdash;'It
was not love'&mdash;for during the three weeks she was almost
constantly with me, fomenting my knee with her hand, night and
day&mdash;I can honestly say, an' please your
honour&mdash;that...once.</p>
<p>That was very odd, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>I think so too&mdash;said Mrs. Wadman.</p>
<p>It never did, said the corporal.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLV.</h2>
<p>&mdash;But 'tis no marvel, continued the corporal&mdash;seeing
my uncle Toby musing upon it&mdash;for Love, an' please your
honour, is exactly like war, in this; that a soldier, though he has
escaped three weeks complete o'Saturday night,&mdash;may
nevertheless be shot through his heart on Sunday morning&mdash;It
happened so here, an' please your honour, with this difference
only&mdash;that it was on Sunday in the afternoon, when I fell in
love all at once with a sisserara&mdash;It burst upon me, an'
please your honour, like a bomb&mdash;scarce giving me time to say,
'God bless me.'</p>
<p>I thought, Trim, said my uncle Toby, a man never fell in love so
very suddenly.</p>
<p>Yes, an' please your honour, if he is in the way of
it&mdash;replied Trim.</p>
<p>I prithee, quoth my uncle Toby, inform me how this matter
happened.</p>
<p>&mdash;With all pleasure, said the corporal, making a bow.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLVI.</h2>
<p>I had escaped, continued the corporal, all that time from
falling in love, and had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it
not been predestined otherwise&mdash;there is no resisting our
fate.</p>
<p>It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your honour.</p>
<p>The old man and his wife had walked out&mdash;</p>
<p>Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the
house&mdash;</p>
<p>There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the
yard&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;When the fair Beguine came in to see me.</p>
<p>My wound was then in a fair way of doing well&mdash;the
inflammation had been gone off for some time, but it was succeeded
with an itching both above and below my knee, so insufferable, that
I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it.</p>
<p>Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel
to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below it&mdash;it
only wants rubbing a little, said the Beguine; so covering it with
the bed-clothes, she began with the fore-finger of her right hand
to rub under my knee, guiding her fore-finger backwards and
forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the dressing.</p>
<p>In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second
finger&mdash;and presently it was laid flat with the other, and she
continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while; it
then came into my head, that I should fall in love&mdash;I blush'd
when I saw how white a hand she had&mdash;I shall never, an' please
your honour, behold another hand so white whilst I live&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Not in that place, said my uncle Toby&mdash;</p>
<p>Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the
corporal&mdash;he could not forbear smiling.</p>
<p>The young Beguine, continued the corporal, perceiving it was of
great service to me&mdash;from rubbing for some time, with two
fingers&mdash;proceeded to rub at length, with three&mdash;till by
little and little she brought down the fourth, and then rubb'd with
her whole hand: I will never say another word, an' please your
honour, upon hands again&mdash;but it was softer than
sattin&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou wilt, said my
uncle Toby; I shall hear thy story with the more delight&mdash;The
corporal thank'd his master most unfeignedly; but having nothing to
say upon the Beguine's hand but the same over again&mdash;he
proceeded to the effects of it.</p>
<p>The fair Beguine, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her
whole hand under my knee&mdash;till I fear'd her zeal would weary
her&mdash;'I would do a thousand times more,' said she, 'for the
love of Christ'&mdash;In saying which, she pass'd her hand across
the flannel, to the part above my knee, which I had equally
complain'd of, and rubb'd it also.</p>
<p>I perceiv'd, then, I was beginning to be in love&mdash;</p>
<p>As she continued rub-rub-rubbing&mdash;I felt it spread from
under her hand, an' please your honour, to every part of my
frame&mdash;</p>
<p>The more she rubb'd, and the longer strokes she took&mdash;the
more the fire kindled in my veins&mdash;till at length, by two or
three strokes longer than the rest&mdash;my passion rose to the
highest pitch&mdash;I seiz'd her hand&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And then thou clapped'st it to thy lips, Trim, said my
uncle Toby&mdash;and madest a speech.</p>
<p>Whether the corporal's amour terminated precisely in the way my
uncle Toby described it, is not material; it is enough that it
contained in it the essence of all the love romances which ever
have been wrote since the beginning of the world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLVII.</h2>
<p>As soon as the corporal had finished the story of his
amour&mdash;or rather my uncle Toby for him&mdash;Mrs. Wadman
silently sallied forth from her arbour, replaced the pin in her
mob, pass'd the wicker gate, and advanced slowly towards my uncle
Toby's sentry-box: the disposition which Trim had made in my uncle
Toby's mind, was too favourable a crisis to be let
slipp'd&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;The attack was determin'd upon: it was facilitated still
more by my uncle Toby's having ordered the corporal to wheel off
the pioneer's shovel, the spade, the pick-axe, the picquets, and
other military stores which lay scatter'd upon the ground where
Dunkirk stood&mdash;The corporal had march'd&mdash;the field was
clear.</p>
<p>Now, consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or
writing, or any thing else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a
man has occasion to do&mdash;to act by plan: for if ever Plan,
independent of all circumstances, deserved registering in letters
of gold (I mean in the archives of Gotham)&mdash;it was certainly
the Plan of Mrs. Wadman's attack of my uncle Toby in his
sentry-box, By Plan&mdash;Now the plan hanging up in it at this
juncture, being the Plan of Dunkirk&mdash;and the tale of Dunkirk a
tale of relaxation, it opposed every impression she could make: and
besides, could she have gone upon it&mdash;the manoeuvre of fingers
and hands in the attack of the sentry-box, was so outdone by that
of the fair Beguine's, in Trim's story&mdash;that just then, that
particular attack, however successful before&mdash;became the most
heartless attack that could be made&mdash;</p>
<p>O! let woman alone for this. Mrs. Wadman had scarce open'd the
wicker-gate, when her genius sported with the change of
circumstances.</p>
<p>&mdash;She formed a new attack in a moment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLVIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;I am half distracted, captain Shandy, said Mrs. Wadman,
holding up her cambrick handkerchief to her left eye, as she
approach'd the door of my uncle Toby's sentry-box&mdash;a
mote&mdash;or sand&mdash;or something&mdash;I know not what, has
got into this eye of mine&mdash;do look into it&mdash;it is not in
the white&mdash;</p>
<p>In saying which, Mrs. Wadman edged herself close in beside my
uncle Toby, and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his
bench, she gave him an opportunity of doing it without rising
up&mdash;Do look into it&mdash;said she.</p>
<p>Honest soul! thou didst look into it with as much innocency of
heart, as ever child look'd into a raree-shew-box; and 'twere as
much a sin to have hurt thee.</p>
<p>&mdash;If a man will be peeping of his own accord into things of
that nature&mdash;I've nothing to say to it&mdash;</p>
<p>My uncle Toby never did: and I will answer for him, that he
would have sat quietly upon a sofa from June to January (which, you
know, takes in both the hot and cold months), with an eye as fine
as the Thracian Rodope's (Rodope Thracia tam inevitabili fascino
instructa, tam exacte oculus intuens attraxit, ut si in illam quis
incidisset, fieri non posset, quin caperetur.&mdash;I know not
who.) besides him, without being able to tell, whether it was a
black or blue one.</p>
<p>The difficulty was to get my uncle Toby, to look at one at
all.</p>
<p>'Tis surmounted. And</p>
<p>I see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand, and the
ashes falling out of it&mdash;looking&mdash;and looking&mdash;then
rubbing his eyes&mdash;and looking again, with twice the
good-nature that ever Galileo look'd for a spot in the sun.</p>
<p>&mdash;In vain! for by all the powers which animate the
organ&mdash;Widow Wadman's left eye shines this moment as lucid as
her right&mdash;there is neither mote, or sand, or dust, or chaff,
or speck, or particle of opake matter floating in it&mdash;There is
nothing, my dear paternal uncle! but one lambent delicious fire,
furtively shooting out from every part of it, in all directions,
into thine&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;If thou lookest, uncle Toby, in search of this mote one
moment longer,&mdash;thou art undone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XLIX.</h2>
<p>An eye is for all the world exactly like a cannon, in this
respect; That it is not so much the eye or the cannon, in
themselves, as it is the carriage of the eye&mdash;and the carriage
of the cannon, by which both the one and the other are enabled to
do so much execution. I don't think the comparison a bad one:
However, as 'tis made and placed at the head of the chapter, as
much for use as ornament, all I desire in return, is, that whenever
I speak of Mrs. Wadman's eyes (except once in the next period),
that you keep it in your fancy.</p>
<p>I protest, Madam, said my uncle Toby, I can see nothing whatever
in your eye.</p>
<p>It is not in the white; said Mrs. Wadman: my uncle Toby look'd
with might and main into the pupil&mdash;</p>
<p>Now of all the eyes which ever were created&mdash;from your own,
Madam, up to those of Venus herself, which certainly were as
venereal a pair of eyes as ever stood in a head&mdash;there never
was an eye of them all, so fitted to rob my uncle Toby of his
repose, as the very eye, at which he was looking&mdash;it was not,
Madam a rolling eye&mdash;a romping or a wanton one&mdash;nor was
it an eye sparkling&mdash;petulant or imperious&mdash;of high
claims and terrifying exactions, which would have curdled at once
that milk of human nature, of which my uncle Toby was made
up&mdash;but 'twas an eye full of gentle salutations&mdash;and soft
responses&mdash;speaking&mdash;not like the trumpet stop of some
ill-made organ, in which many an eye I talk to, holds coarse
converse&mdash;but whispering soft&mdash;like the last low accent
of an expiring saint&mdash;'How can you live comfortless, captain
Shandy, and alone, without a bosom to lean your head on&mdash;or
trust your cares to?'</p>
<p>It was an eye&mdash;</p>
<p>But I shall be in love with it myself, if I say another word
about it.</p>
<p>&mdash;It did my uncle Toby's business.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.L.</h2>
<p>There is nothing shews the character of my father and my uncle
Toby, in a more entertaining light, than their different manner of
deportment, under the same accident&mdash;for I call not love a
misfortune, from a persuasion, that a man's heart is ever the
better for it&mdash;Great God! what must my uncle Toby's have been,
when 'twas all benignity without it.</p>
<p>My father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject
to this passion, before he married&mdash;but from a little subacid
kind of drollish impatience in his nature, whenever it befell him,
he would never submit to it like a christian; but would pish, and
huff, and bounce, and kick, and play the Devil, and write the
bitterest Philippicks against the eye that ever man
wrote&mdash;there is one in verse upon somebody's eye or other,
that for two or three nights together, had put him by his rest;
which in his first transport of resentment against it, he begins
thus:</p>
<pre>
   'A Devil 'tis&mdash;and mischief such doth work
   As never yet did Pagan, Jew, or Turk.'
</pre>
<p>(This will be printed with my father's Life of Socrates, &amp;c.
&amp;c.)</p>
<p>In short, during the whole paroxism, my father was all abuse and
foul language, approaching rather towards malediction&mdash;only he
did not do it with as much method as Ernulphus&mdash;he was too
impetuous; nor with Ernulphus's policy&mdash;for tho' my father,
with the most intolerant spirit, would curse both this and that,
and every thing under heaven, which was either aiding or abetting
to his love&mdash;yet never concluded his chapter of curses upon
it, without cursing himself in at the bargain, as one of the most
egregious fools and cox-combs, he would say, that ever was let
loose in the world.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby, on the contrary, took it like a lamb&mdash;sat
still and let the poison work in his veins without
resistance&mdash;in the sharpest exacerbations of his wound (like
that on his groin) he never dropt one fretful or discontented
word&mdash;he blamed neither heaven nor earth&mdash;or thought or
spoke an injurious thing of any body, or any part of it; he sat
solitary and pensive with his pipe&mdash;looking at his lame
leg&mdash;then whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho! which mixing
with the smoke, incommoded no one mortal.</p>
<p>He took it like a lamb&mdash;I say.</p>
<p>In truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride
with my father, that very morning, to save if possible a beautiful
wood, which the dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the
poor (Mr. Shandy must mean the poor in spirit; inasmuch as they
divided the money amongst themselves.); which said wood being in
full view of my uncle Toby's house, and of singular service to him
in his description of the battle of Wynnendale&mdash;by trotting on
too hastily to save it&mdash;upon an uneasy saddle&mdash;worse
horse, &amp;c. &amp;c...it had so happened, that the serous part of
the blood had got betwixt the two skins, in the nethermost part of
my uncle Toby&mdash;the first shootings of which (as my uncle Toby
had no experience of love) he had taken for a part of the
passion&mdash;till the blister breaking in the one case&mdash;and
the other remaining&mdash;my uncle Toby was presently convinced,
that his wound was not a skin-deep wound&mdash;but that it had gone
to his heart.</p>

<p>The world is ashamed of being virtuous&mdash;my uncle Toby knew
little of the world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with
widow Wadman, he had no conception that the thing was any more to
be made a mystery of, than if Mrs. Wadman had given him a cut with
a gap'd knife across his finger: Had it been otherwise&mdash;yet as
he ever look'd upon Trim as a humble friend; and saw fresh reasons
every day of his life, to treat him as such&mdash;it would have
made no variation in the manner in which he informed him of the
affair.</p>
<p>'I am in love, corporal!' quoth my uncle Toby.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LII.</h2>
<p>In love!&mdash;said the corporal&mdash;your honour was very well
the day before yesterday, when I was telling your honour of the
story of the King of Bohemia&mdash;Bohemia! said my uncle
Toby...musing a long time...What became of that story, Trim?</p>
<p>&mdash;We lost it, an' please your honour, somehow betwixt
us&mdash;but your honour was as free from love then, as I
am&mdash;'twas just whilst thou went'st off with the
wheel-barrow&mdash;with Mrs. Wadman, quoth my uncle Toby&mdash;She
has left a ball here&mdash;added my uncle Toby&mdash;pointing to
his breast&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;She can no more, an' please your honour, stand a siege,
than she can fly&mdash;cried the corporal&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But as we are neighbours, Trim,&mdash;the best way I
think is to let her know it civilly first&mdash;quoth my uncle
Toby.</p>
<p>Now if I might presume, said the corporal, to differ from your
honour&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Why else do I talk to thee, Trim? said my uncle Toby,
mildly&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Then I would begin, an' please your honour, with making a
good thundering attack upon her, in return&mdash;and telling her
civilly afterwards&mdash;for if she knows any thing of your
honour's being in love, before hand&mdash;L..d help her!&mdash;she
knows no more at present of it, Trim, said my uncle Toby&mdash;than
the child unborn&mdash;</p>
<p>Precious souls&mdash;!</p>
<p>Mrs. Wadman had told it, with all its circumstances, to Mrs.
Bridget twenty-four hours before; and was at that very moment
sitting in council with her, touching some slight misgivings with
regard to the issue of the affairs, which the Devil, who never lies
dead in a ditch, had put into her head&mdash;before he would allow
half time, to get quietly through her Te Deum.</p>
<p>I am terribly afraid, said widow Wadman, in case I should marry
him, Bridget&mdash;that the poor captain will not enjoy his health,
with the monstrous wound upon his groin&mdash;</p>
<p>It may not, Madam, be so very large, replied Bridget, as you
think&mdash;and I believe, besides, added she&mdash;that 'tis dried
up&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I could like to know&mdash;merely for his sake, said Mrs.
Wadman&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;We'll know and long and the broad of it, in ten
days&mdash;answered Mrs. Bridget, for whilst the captain is paying
his addresses to you&mdash;I'm confident Mr. Trim will be for
making love to me&mdash;and I'll let him as much as he
will&mdash;added Bridget&mdash;to get it all out of him&mdash;</p>
<p>The measures were taken at once&mdash;and my uncle Toby and the
corporal went on with theirs.</p>
<p>Now, quoth the corporal, setting his left hand a-kimbo, and
giving such a flourish with his right, as just promised
success&mdash;and no more&mdash;if your honour will give me leave
to lay down the plan of this attack&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Thou wilt please me by it, Trim, said my uncle Toby,
exceedingly&mdash;and as I foresee thou must act in it as my aid de
camp, here's a crown, corporal, to begin with, to steep thy
commission.</p>
<p>Then, an' please your honour, said the corporal (making a bow
first for his commission)&mdash;we will begin with getting your
honour's laced clothes out of the great campaign-trunk, to be well
air'd, and have the blue and gold taken up at the sleeves&mdash;and
I'll put your white ramallie-wig fresh into pipes&mdash;and send
for a taylor, to have your honour's thin scarlet breeches
turn'd&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I had better take the red plush ones, quoth my uncle
Toby&mdash;They will be too clumsy&mdash;said the corporal.</p>

Fever's regimental coat, which your honour gave me to wear for his
sake&mdash;and as soon as your honour is clean shaved&mdash;and has
got your clean shirt on, with your blue and gold, or your fine
scarlet&mdash;sometimes one and sometimes t'other&mdash;and every
thing is ready for the attack&mdash;we'll march up boldly, as if
'twas to the face of a bastion; and whilst your honour engages Mrs.
Wadman in the parlour, to the right&mdash;I'll attack Mrs. Bridget
in the kitchen, to the left; and having seiz'd the pass, I'll

head&mdash;that the day is our own.</p>
<p>I wish I may but manage it right; said my uncle Toby&mdash;but I
declare, corporal, I had rather march up to the very edge of a

<h2>Chapter 4.LV.</h2>
<p>If any thing in this world, which my father said, could have
provoked my uncle Toby, during the time he was in love, it was the
perverse use my father was always making of an expression of
Hilarion the hermit; who, in speaking of his abstinence, his
watchings, flagellations, and other instrumental parts of his
religion&mdash;would say&mdash;tho' with more facetiousness than
became an hermit&mdash;'That they were the means he used, to make
his ass (meaning his body) leave off kicking.'</p>
<p>It pleased my father well; it was not only a laconick way of
expressing&mdash;but of libelling, at the same time, the desires
and appetites of the lower part of us; so that for many years of my
father's life, 'twas his constant mode of expression&mdash;he never
used the word passions once&mdash;but ass always instead of
them&mdash;So that he might be said truly, to have been upon the
bones, or the back of his own ass, or else of some other man's,
during all that time.</p>
<p>I must here observe to you the difference betwixt My father's
ass and my hobby-horse&mdash;in order to keep characters as
separate as may be, in our fancies as we go along.</p>
<p>For my hobby-horse, if you recollect a little, is no way a
vicious beast; he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about
him&mdash;'Tis the sporting little filly-folly which carries you
out for the present hour&mdash;a maggot, a butterfly, a picture, a
fiddlestick&mdash;an uncle Toby's siege&mdash;or an any thing,
which a man makes a shift to get a-stride on, to canter it away
from the cares and solicitudes of life&mdash;'Tis as useful a beast
as is in the whole creation&mdash;nor do I really see how the world
could do without it&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But for my father's ass&mdash;oh! mount him&mdash;mount
him&mdash;mount him&mdash;(that's three times, is it
not?)&mdash;mount him not:&mdash;'tis a beast
concupiscent&mdash;and foul befal the man, who does not hinder him
from kicking.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LVI.</h2>
<p>Well! dear brother Toby, said my father, upon his first seeing
him after he fell in love&mdash;and how goes it with your Asse?</p>
<p>Now my uncle Toby thinking more of the part where he had had the
blister, than of Hilarion's metaphor&mdash;and our preconceptions
having (you know) as great a power over the sounds of words as the
shapes of things, he had imagined, that my father, who was not very
ceremonious in his choice of words, had enquired after the part by
its proper name: so notwithstanding my mother, doctor Slop, and Mr.
Yorick, were sitting in the parlour, he thought it rather civil to
conform to the term my father had made use of than not. When a man
is hemm'd in by two indecorums, and must commit one of 'em&mdash;I
always observe&mdash;let him chuse which he will, the world will
blame him&mdash;so I should not be astonished if it blames my uncle
Toby.</p>
<p>My A..e, quoth my uncle Toby, is much better&mdash;brother
Shandy&mdash;My father had formed great expectations from his Asse
in this onset; and would have brought him on again; but doctor Slop
setting up an intemperate laugh&mdash;and my mother crying out L...
bless us!&mdash;it drove my father's Asse off the field&mdash;and
the laugh then becoming general&mdash;there was no bringing him
back to the charge, for some time&mdash;</p>
<p>And so the discourse went on without him.</p>
<p>Every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother
Toby,&mdash;and we hope it is true.</p>
<p>I am as much in love, sister, I believe, replied my uncle Toby,
as any man usually is&mdash;Humph! said my father&mdash;and when
did you know it? quoth my mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;When the blister broke; replied my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby's reply put my father into good temper&mdash;so he
charg'd o' foot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LVII.</h2>
<p>As the ancients agree, brother Toby, said my father, that there
are two different and distinct kinds of love, according to the
different parts which are affected by it&mdash;the Brain or
Liver&mdash;I think when a man is in love, it behoves him a little
to consider which of the two he is fallen into.</p>
<p>What signifies it, brother Shandy, replied my uncle Toby, which
of the two it is, provided it will but make a man marry, and love
his wife, and get a few children?</p>
<p>&mdash;A few children! cried my father, rising out of his chair,
and looking full in my mother's face, as he forced his way betwixt
her's and doctor Slop's&mdash;a few children! cried my father,
repeating my uncle Toby's words as he walk'd to and fro&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Not, my dear brother Toby, cried my father, recovering
himself all at once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle
Toby's chair&mdash;not that I should be sorry hadst thou a
score&mdash;on the contrary, I should rejoice&mdash;and be as kind,
Toby, to every one of them as a father&mdash;</p>
<p>My uncle Toby stole his hand unperceived behind his chair, to
give my father's a squeeze&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my uncle
Toby's hand&mdash;so much dost thou possess, my dear Toby, of the
milk of human nature, and so little of its asperities&mdash;'tis
piteous the world is not peopled by creatures which resemble thee;
and was I an Asiatic monarch, added my father, heating himself with
his new project&mdash;I would oblige thee, provided it would not
impair thy strength&mdash;or dry up thy radical moisture too
fast&mdash;or weaken thy memory or fancy, brother Toby, which these
gymnics inordinately taken are apt to do&mdash;else, dear Toby, I
would procure thee the most beautiful woman in my empire, and I
would oblige thee, nolens, volens, to beget for me one subject
every month&mdash;</p>
<p>As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence&mdash;my
mother took a pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>Now I would not, quoth my uncle Toby, get a child, nolens,
volens, that is, whether I would or no, to please the greatest
prince upon earth&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And 'twould be cruel in me, brother Toby, to compel thee;
said my father&mdash;but 'tis a case put to shew thee, that it is
not thy begetting a child&mdash;in case thou should'st be
able&mdash;but the system of Love and Marriage thou goest upon,
which I would set thee right in&mdash;</p>
<p>There is at least, said Yorick, a great deal of reason and plain
sense in captain Shandy's opinion of love; and 'tis amongst the
ill-spent hours of my life, which I have to answer for, that I have
read so many flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time, from
whom I never could extract so much&mdash;I wish, Yorick, said my
father, you had read Plato; for there you would have learnt that
there are two Loves&mdash;I know there were two Religions, replied
Yorick, amongst the ancients&mdash;one&mdash;for the vulgar, and
another for the learned;&mdash;but I think One Love might have
served both of them very well&mdash;</p>
<p>I could not; replied my father&mdash;and for the same reasons:
for of these Loves, according to Ficinus's comment upon Velasius,
the one is rational&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;the other is natural&mdash;the first
ancient&mdash;without mother&mdash;where Venus had nothing to do:
the second, begotten of Jupiter and Dione&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Pray, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, what has a man who
believes in God to do with this? My father could not stop to
answer, for fear of breaking the thread of his discourse&mdash;</p>
<p>This latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of
Venus.</p>
<p>The first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven,
excites to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the
desire of philosophy and truth&mdash;the second, excites to desire,
simply&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the
world, said Yorick, as the finding out the longitude&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;To be sure, said my mother, love keeps peace in the
world&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;In the house&mdash;my dear, I own&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It replenishes the earth; said my mother&mdash;</p>
<p>But it keeps heaven empty&mdash;my dear; replied my father.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis Virginity, cried Slop, triumphantly, which fills
paradise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LVIII.</h2>
<p>My father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a slashing way
with him in his disputations, thrusting and ripping, and giving
every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn&mdash;that if
there were twenty people in company&mdash;in less than half an hour
he was sure to have every one of 'em against him.</p>
<p>What did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an
ally, was, that if there was any one post more untenable than the
rest, he would be sure to throw himself into it; and to do him
justice, when he was once there, he would defend it so gallantly,
that 'twould have been a concern, either to a brave man or a
good-natured one, to have seen him driven out.</p>
<p>Yorick, for this reason, though he would often attack
him&mdash;yet could never bear to do it with all his force.</p>
<p>Doctor Slop's Virginity, in the close of the last chapter, had
got him for once on the right side of the rampart; and he was
beginning to blow up all the convents in Christendom about Slop's
ears, when corporal Trim came into the parlour to inform my uncle
Toby, that his thin scarlet breeches, in which the attack was to be
made upon Mrs. Wadman, would not do; for that the taylor, in
ripping them up, in order to turn them, had found they had been
turn'd before&mdash;Then turn them again, brother, said my father,
rapidly, for there will be many a turning of 'em yet before all's
done in the affair&mdash;They are as rotten as dirt, said the
corporal&mdash;Then by all means, said my father, bespeak a new
pair, brother&mdash;for though I know, continued my father, turning
himself to the company, that widow Wadman has been deeply in love
with my brother Toby for many years, and has used every art and
circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion, yet now
that she has caught him&mdash;her fever will be pass'd its
height&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;She has gained her point.</p>
<p>In this case, continued my father, which Plato, I am persuaded,
never thought of&mdash;Love, you see, is not so much a Sentiment as
a Situation, into which a man enters, as my brother Toby would do,
into a corps&mdash;no matter whether he loves the service or
no&mdash;being once in it&mdash;he acts as if he did; and takes
every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.</p>
<p>The hypothesis, like the rest of my father's, was plausible
enough, and my uncle Toby had but a single word to object to
it&mdash;in which Trim stood ready to second him&mdash;but my
father had not drawn his conclusion&mdash;</p>
<p>For this reason, continued my father (stating the case over
again)&mdash;notwithstanding all the world knows, that Mrs. Wadman
affects my brother Toby&mdash;and my brother Toby contrariwise
affects Mrs. Wadman, and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music
striking up this very night, yet will I answer for it, that this
self-same tune will not be play'd this twelvemonth.</p>
<p>We have taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle Toby, looking
up interrogatively in Trim's face.</p>
<p>I would lay my Montero-cap, said Trim&mdash;Now Trim's
Montero-cap, as I once told you, was his constant wager; and having
furbish'd it up that very night, in order to go upon the
attack&mdash;it made the odds look more considerable&mdash;I would
lay, an' please your honour, my Montero-cap to a shilling&mdash;was
it proper, continued Trim (making a bow), to offer a wager before
your honours&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;There is nothing improper in it, said my
father&mdash;'tis a mode of expression; for in saying thou would'st
lay thy Montero-cap to a shilling&mdash;all thou meanest is
this&mdash;that thou believest&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Now, What do'st thou believe?</p>
<p>That widow Wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out
ten days&mdash;</p>
<p>And whence, cried Slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge
of woman, friend?</p>
<p>By falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said Trim.</p>
<p>'Twas a Beguine, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>Doctor Slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction;
and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter
upon the whole order of Nuns and Beguines, a set of silly, fusty,
baggages&mdash;Slop could not stand it&mdash;and my uncle Toby
having some measures to take about his breeches&mdash;and Yorick
about his fourth general division&mdash;in order for their several
attacks next day&mdash;the company broke up: and my father being
left alone, and having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that and
bed-time; he called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote my uncle
Toby the following letter of instructions:</p>
<p>My dear brother Toby,</p>
<p>What I am going to say to thee is upon the nature of women, and
of love-making to them; and perhaps it is as well for
thee&mdash;tho' not so well for me&mdash;that thou hast occasion
for a letter of instructions upon that head, and that I am able to
write it to thee.</p>
<p>Had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our
lots&mdash;and thou no sufferer by the knowledge, I had been well
content that thou should'st have dipp'd the pen this moment into
the ink, instead of myself; but that not being the case&mdash;Mrs.
Shandy being now close beside me, preparing for bed&mdash;I have
thrown together without order, and just as they have come into my
mind, such hints and documents as I deem may be of use to thee;
intending, in this, to give thee a token of my love; not doubting,
my dear Toby, of the manner in which it will be accepted.</p>
<p>In the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion
in the affair&mdash;though I perceive from a glow in my cheek, that
I blush as I begin to speak to thee upon the subject, as well
knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of its
offices thou neglectest&mdash;yet I would remind thee of one
(during the continuance of thy courtship) in a particular manner,
which I would not have omitted; and that is, never to go forth upon
the enterprize, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon,
without first recommending thyself to the protection of Almighty
God, that he may defend thee from the evil one.</p>
<p>Shave the whole top of thy crown clean once at least every four
or five days, but oftner if convenient; lest in taking off thy wig
before her, thro' absence of mind, she should be able to discover
how much has been cut away by Time&mdash;how much by Trim.</p>
<p>&mdash;'Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her
fancy.</p>
<p>Always carry it in thy mind, and act upon it as a sure maxim,
Toby&mdash;</p>
<p>'That women are timid:' And 'tis well they are&mdash;else there
would be no dealing with them.</p>
<p>Let not thy breeches be too tight, or hang too loose about thy
thighs, like the trunk-hose of our ancestors.</p>
<p>&mdash;A just medium prevents all conclusions.</p>
<p>Whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to
utter it in a low soft tone of voice. Silence, and whatever
approaches it, weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain:
For this cause, if thou canst help it, never throw down the tongs
and poker.</p>
<p>Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse
with her, and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time, to
keep her from all books and writings which tend thereto: there are
some devotional tracts, which if thou canst entice her to read
over&mdash;it will be well: but suffer her not to look into
Rabelais, or Scarron, or Don Quixote&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;They are all books which excite laughter; and thou
knowest, dear Toby, that there is no passion so serious as
lust.</p>
<p>Stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt, before thou enterest her
parlour.</p>
<p>And if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her,
and she gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hers&mdash;beware
of taking it&mdash;thou canst not lay thy hand on hers, but she
will feel the temper of thine. Leave that and as many other things
as thou canst, quite undetermined; by so doing, thou wilt have her
curiosity on thy side; and if she is not conquered by that, and thy
Asse continues still kicking, which there is great reason to
suppose&mdash;Thou must begin, with first losing a few ounces of
blood below the ears, according to the practice of the ancient
Scythians, who cured the most intemperate fits of the appetite by
that means.</p>
<p>Avicenna, after this, is for having the part anointed with the
syrup of hellebore, using proper evacuations and purges&mdash;and I
believe rightly. But thou must eat little or no goat's flesh, nor
red deer&mdash;nor even foal's flesh by any means; and carefully
abstain&mdash;that is, as much as thou canst, from peacocks,
cranes, coots, didappers, and water-hens&mdash;</p>
<p>As for thy drink&mdash;I need not tell thee, it must be the
infusion of Vervain and the herb Hanea, of which Aelian relates
such effects&mdash;but if thy stomach palls with
it&mdash;discontinue it from time to time, taking cucumbers,
melons, purslane, water-lillies, woodbine, and lettice, in the
stead of them.</p>
<p>There is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at
present&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Unless the breaking out of a fresh war&mdash;So wishing
every thing, dear Toby, for best,</p>
<p>I rest thy affectionate brother,</p>
<p>Walter Shandy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LIX.</h2>
<p>Whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions, my
uncle Toby and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for
the attack. As the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid
aside (at least for the present), there was nothing which should
put it off beyond the next morning; so accordingly it was resolv'd
upon, for eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>Come, my dear, said my father to my mother&mdash;'twill be but
like a brother and sister, if you and I take a walk down to my
brother Toby's&mdash;to countenance him in this attack of his.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby and the corporal had been accoutred both some
time, when my father and mother enter'd, and the clock striking
eleven, were that moment in motion to sally forth&mdash;but the
account of this is worth more than to be wove into the fag end of
the eighth (Alluding to the first edition.) volume of such a work
as this.&mdash;My father had no time but to put the letter of
instructions into my uncle Toby's coat-pocket&mdash;and join with
my mother in wishing his attack prosperous.</p>
<p>I could like, said my mother, to look through the key-hole out
of curiosity&mdash;Call it by its right name, my dear, quoth my
father&mdash;</p>
<p>And look through the key-hole as long as you will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LX.</h2>
<p>I call all the powers of time and chance, which severally check
us in our careers in this world, to bear me witness, that I could
never yet get fairly to my uncle Toby's amours, till this very
moment, that my mother's curiosity, as she stated the
affair,&mdash;or a different impulse in her, as my father would
have it&mdash;wished her to take a peep at them through the
key-hole.</p>
<p>'Call it, my dear, by its right name, quoth my father, and look
through the key-hole as long as you will.'</p>
<p>Nothing but the fermentation of that little subacid humour,
which I have often spoken of, in my father's habit, could have
vented such an insinuation&mdash;he was however frank and generous
in his nature, and at all times open to conviction; so that he had
scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort, when his
conscience smote him.</p>
<p>My mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted
under his right, in such wise, that the inside of her hand rested
upon the back of his&mdash;she raised her fingers, and let them
fall&mdash;it could scarce be call'd a tap; or if it was a
tap&mdash;'twould have puzzled a casuist to say, whether 'twas a
tap of remonstrance, or a tap of confession: my father, who was all
sensibilities from head to foot, class'd it right&mdash;Conscience
redoubled her blow&mdash;he turn'd his face suddenly the other way,
and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order
to move homewards, by a cross movement of her right leg, keeping
her left as its centre, brought herself so far in front, that as he
turned his head, he met her eye&mdash;Confusion again! he saw a
thousand reasons to wipe out the reproach, and as many to reproach
himself&mdash;a thin, blue, chill, pellucid chrystal with all its
humours so at rest, the least mote or speck of desire might have
been seen, at the bottom of it, had it existed&mdash;it did
not&mdash;and how I happen to be so lewd myself, particularly a
little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes&mdash;Heaven above
knows&mdash;My mother&mdash;madam&mdash;was so at no time, either
by nature, by institution, or example.</p>
<p>A temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in
all months of the year, and in all critical moments both of the day
and night alike; nor did she superinduce the least heat into her
humours from the manual effervescencies of devotional tracts, which
having little or no meaning in them, nature is oft-times obliged to
find one&mdash;And as for my father's example! 'twas so far from
being either aiding or abetting thereunto, that 'twas the whole
business of his life, to keep all fancies of that kind out of her
head&mdash;Nature had done her part, to have spared him this
trouble; and what was not a little inconsistent, my father knew
it&mdash;And here am I sitting, this 12th day of August 1766, in a
purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers, without either wig or
cap on, a most tragicomical completion of his prediction, 'That I
should neither think, nor act like any other man's child, upon that
very account.'</p>
<p>The mistake in my father, was in attacking my mother's motive,
instead of the act itself; for certainly key-holes were made for
other purposes; and considering the act, as an act which interfered
with a true proposition, and denied a key-hole to be what it
was&mdash;it became a violation of nature; and was so far, you see,
criminal.</p>
<p>It is for this reason, an' please your Reverences, That
key-holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness, than all
other holes in this world put together.</p>
<p>&mdash;which leads me to my uncle Toby's amours.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXI.</h2>
<p>Though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my
uncle Toby's great ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too
short to produce any great effects from it: it had lain many years
squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk; and as bad
forms are not so easy to be got the better of, and the use of
candle-ends not so well understood, it was not so pliable a
business as one would have wished. The corporal with cheary eye and
both arms extended, had fallen back perpendicular from it a score
times, to inspire it, if possible, with a better air&mdash;had
Spleen given a look at it, 'twould have cost her ladyship a
smile&mdash;it curl'd every where but where the corporal would have
it; and where a buckle or two, in his opinion, would have done it
honour, he could as soon have raised the dead.</p>
<p>Such it was&mdash;or rather such would it have seem'd upon any
other brow; but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle
Toby's, assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself,
and Nature had moreover wrote Gentleman with so fair a hand in
every line of his countenance, that even his tarnish'd gold-laced
hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him; and though not
worth a button in themselves, yet the moment my uncle Toby put them
on, they became serious objects, and altogether seem'd to have been
picked up by the hand of Science to set him off to advantage.</p>
<p>Nothing in this world could have co-operated more powerfully
towards this, than my uncle Toby's blue and gold&mdash;had not
Quantity in some measure been necessary to Grace: in a period of
fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made, by a total
inactivity in my uncle Toby's life, for he seldom went further than
the bowling-green&mdash;his blue and gold had become so miserably
too straight for him, that it was with the utmost difficulty the
corporal was able to get him into them; the taking them up at the
sleeves, was of no advantage.&mdash;They were laced however down
the back, and at the seams of the sides, &amp;c. in the mode of
King William's reign; and to shorten all description, they shone so
bright against the sun that morning, and had so metallick and
doughty an air with them, that had my uncle Toby thought of
attacking in armour, nothing could have so well imposed upon his
imagination.</p>
<p>As for the thin scarlet breeches, they had been unripp'd by the
taylor between the legs, and left at sixes and sevens&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Yes, Madam,&mdash;but let us govern our fancies. It is
enough they were held impracticable the night before, and as there
was no alternative in my uncle Toby's wardrobe, he sallied forth in
the red plush.</p>
<p>The corporal had array'd himself in poor Le Fever's regimental
coat; and with his hair tuck'd up under his Montero-cap, which he
had furbish'd up for the occasion, march'd three paces distant from
his master: a whiff of military pride had puff'd out his shirt at
the wrist; and upon that in a black leather thong clipp'd into a
tassel beyond the knot, hung the corporal's stick&mdash;my uncle
Toby carried his cane like a pike.</p>
<p>&mdash;It looks well at least; quoth my father to himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXII.</h2>
<p>My uncle Toby turn'd his head more than once behind him, to see
how he was supported by the corporal; and the corporal as oft as he
did it, gave a slight flourish with his stick&mdash;but not
vapouringly; and with the sweetest accent of most respectful
encouragement, bid his honour 'never fear.'</p>
<p>Now my uncle Toby did fear; and grievously too; he knew not (as
my father had reproach'd him) so much as the right end of a Woman
from the wrong, and therefore was never altogether at his ease near
any one of them&mdash;unless in sorrow or distress; then infinite
was his pity; nor would the most courteous knight of romance have
gone further, at least upon one leg, to have wiped away a tear from
a woman's eye; and yet excepting once that he was beguiled into it
by Mrs. Wadman, he had never looked stedfastly into one; and would
often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart, that it was
almost (if not about) as bad as taking bawdy.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And suppose it is? my father would say.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXIII.</h2>
<p>She cannot, quoth my uncle Toby, halting, when they had march'd
up to within twenty paces of Mrs. Wadman's door&mdash;she cannot,
corporal, take it amiss.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;She will take it, an' please your honour, said the
corporal, just as the Jew's widow at Lisbon took it of my brother
Tom.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And how was that? quoth my uncle Toby, facing quite about
to the corporal.</p>
<p>Your honour, replied the corporal, knows of Tom's misfortunes;
but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this,
That if Tom had not married the widow&mdash;or had it pleased God
after their marriage, that they had but put pork into their
sausages, the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed,
and dragg'd to the inquisition&mdash;'Tis a cursed
place&mdash;added the corporal, shaking his head,&mdash;when once a
poor creature is in, he is in, an' please your honour, for
ever.</p>
<p>'Tis very true; said my uncle Toby, looking gravely at Mrs.
Wadman's house, as he spoke.</p>
<p>Nothing, continued the corporal, can be so sad as confinement
for life&mdash;or so sweet, an' please your honour, as liberty.</p>
<p>Nothing, Trim&mdash;said my uncle Toby, musing&mdash;</p>
<p>Whilst a man is free,&mdash;cried the corporal, giving a
flourish with his stick thus&mdash;</p>
<p>(squiggly line diagonally across the page)</p>
<p>A thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have
said more for celibacy.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby look'd earnestly towards his cottage and his
bowling-green.</p>
<p>The corporal had unwarily conjured up the Spirit of calculation
with his wand; and he had nothing to do, but to conjure him down
again with his story, and in this form of Exorcism, most
un-ecclesiastically did the corporal do it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXIV.</h2>
<p>As Tom's place, an' please your honour, was easy&mdash;and the
weather warm&mdash;it put him upon thinking seriously of settling
himself in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a
Jew who kept a sausage shop in the same street, had the ill luck to
die of a strangury, and leave his widow in possession of a rousing
trade&mdash;Tom thought (as every body in Lisbon was doing the best
he could devise for himself) there could be no harm in offering her
his service to carry it on: so without any introduction to the
widow, except that of buying a pound of sausages at her
shop&mdash;Tom set out&mdash;counting the matter thus within
himself, as he walk'd along; that let the worst come of it that
could, he should at least get a pound of sausages for their
worth&mdash;but, if things went well, he should be set up; inasmuch
as he should get not only a pound of sausages&mdash;but a wife
and&mdash;a sausage shop, an' please your honour, into the
bargain.</p>
<p>Every servant in the family, from high to low, wish'd Tom
success; and I can fancy, an' please your honour, I see him this
moment with his white dimity waist-coat and breeches, and hat a
little o' one side, passing jollily along the street, swinging his
stick, with a smile and a chearful word for every body he
met:&mdash;But alas! Tom! thou smilest no more, cried the corporal,
looking on one side of him upon the ground, as if he apostrophised
him in his dungeon.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! said my uncle Toby, feelingly.</p>
<p>He was an honest, light-hearted lad, an' please your honour, as
ever blood warm'd&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Then he resembled thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby,
rapidly.</p>
<p>The corporal blush'd down to his fingers ends&mdash;a tear of
sentimental bashfulness&mdash;another of gratitude to my uncle
Toby&mdash;and a tear of sorrow for his brother's misfortunes,
started into his eye, and ran sweetly down his cheek together; my
uncle Toby's kindled as one lamp does at another; and taking hold
of the breast of Trim's coat (which had been that of Le Fever's) as
if to ease his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer
feeling&mdash;he stood silent for a minute and a half; at the end
of which he took his hand away, and the corporal making a bow, went
on with his story of his brother and the Jew's widow.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXV.</h2>
<p>When Tom, an' please your honour, got to the shop, there was
nobody in it, but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers
slightly tied to the end of a long cane, flapping away
flies&mdash;not killing them.&mdash;'Tis a pretty picture! said my
uncle Toby&mdash;she had suffered persecution, Trim, and had learnt
mercy&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;She was good, an' please your honour, from nature, as
well as from hardships; and there are circumstances in the story of
that poor friendless slut, that would melt a heart of stone, said
Trim; and some dismal winter's evening, when your honour is in the
humour, they shall be told you with the rest of Tom's story, for it
makes a part of it&mdash;</p>
<p>Then do not forget, Trim, said my uncle Toby.</p>
<p>A negro has a soul? an' please your honour, said the corporal
(doubtingly).</p>
<p>I am not much versed, corporal, quoth my uncle Toby, in things
of that kind; but I suppose, God would not leave him without one,
any more than thee or me&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It would be putting one sadly over the head of another,
quoth the corporal.</p>
<p>It would so; said my uncle Toby. Why then, an' please your
honour, is a black wench to be used worse than a white one?</p>
<p>I can give no reason, said my uncle Toby&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Only, cried the corporal, shaking his head, because she
has no one to stand up for her&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth my uncle
Toby,&mdash;which recommends her to protection&mdash;and her
brethren with her; 'tis the fortune of war which has put the whip
into our hands now&mdash;where it may be hereafter, heaven
knows!&mdash;but be it where it will, the brave, Trim! will not use
it unkindly.</p>
<p>&mdash;God forbid, said the corporal.</p>
<p>Amen, responded my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon his
heart.</p>
<p>The corporal returned to his story, and went on&mdash;but with
an embarrassment in doing it, which here and there a reader in this
world will not be able to comprehend; for by the many sudden
transitions all along, from one kind and cordial passion to
another, in getting thus far on his way, he had lost the sportable
key of his voice, which gave sense and spirit to his tale: he
attempted twice to resume it, but could not please himself; so
giving a stout hem! to rally back the retreating spirits, and
aiding nature at the same time with his left arm a kimbo on one
side, and with his right a little extended, supporting her on the
other&mdash;the corporal got as near the note as he could; and in
that attitude, continued his story.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXVI.</h2>
<p>As Tom, an' please your honour, had no business at that time
with the Moorish girl, he passed on into the room beyond, to talk
to the Jew's widow about love&mdash;and this pound of sausages; and
being, as I have told your honour, an open cheary-hearted lad, with
his character wrote in his looks and carriage, he took a chair, and
without much apology, but with great civility at the same time,
placed it close to her at the table, and sat down.</p>
<p>There is nothing so awkward, as courting a woman, an' please
your honour, whilst she is making sausages&mdash;So Tom began a
discourse upon them; first, gravely,&mdash;'as how they were
made&mdash;with what meats, herbs, and spices.'&mdash;Then a little
gayly,&mdash;as, 'With what skins&mdash;and if they never
burst&mdash;Whether the largest were not the best?'&mdash;and so
on&mdash;taking care only as he went along, to season what he had
to say upon sausages, rather under than over;&mdash;that he might
have room to act in&mdash;</p>
<p>It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution, said my
uncle Toby, laying his hand upon Trim's shoulder, that Count De la
Motte lost the battle of Wynendale: he pressed too speedily into
the wood; which if he had not done, Lisle had not fallen into our
hands, nor Ghent and Bruges, which both followed her example; it
was so late in the year, continued my uncle Toby, and so terrible a
season came on, that if things had not fallen out as they did, our
troops must have perish'd in the open field.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Why, therefore, may not battles, an' please your honour,
as well as marriages, be made in heaven?&mdash;my uncle Toby
mused&mdash;</p>
<p>Religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of
military skill tempted him to say another; so not being able to
frame a reply exactly to his mind&mdash;my uncle Toby said nothing
at all; and the corporal finished his story.</p>
<p>As Tom perceived, an' please your honour, that he gained ground,
and that all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly
taken, he went on to help her a little in making them.&mdash;First,
by taking hold of the ring of the sausage whilst she stroked the
forced meat down with her hand&mdash;then by cutting the strings
into proper lengths, and holding them in his hand, whilst she took
them out one by one&mdash;then, by putting them across her mouth,
that she might take them out as she wanted them&mdash;and so on
from little to more, till at last he adventured to tie the sausage
himself, whilst she held the snout.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Now a widow, an' please your honour, always chuses a
second husband as unlike the first as she can: so the affair was
more than half settled in her mind before Tom mentioned it.</p>
<p>She made a feint however of defending herself, by snatching up a
sausage:&mdash;Tom instantly laid hold of another&mdash;</p>
<p>But seeing Tom's had more gristle in it&mdash;</p>
<p>She signed the capitulation&mdash;and Tom sealed it; and there
was an end of the matter.</p>

<p>All womankind, continued Trim, (commenting upon his story) from
the highest to the lowest, an' please your honour, love jokes; the
difficulty is to know how they chuse to have them cut; and there is
no knowing that, but by trying, as we do with our artillery in the
field, by raising or letting down their breeches, till we hit the
mark.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I like the comparison, said my uncle Toby, better than
the thing itself&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Because your honour, quoth the corporal, loves glory,
more than pleasure.</p>
<p>I hope, Trim, answered my uncle Toby, I love mankind more than
either; and as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the
good and quiet of the world&mdash;and particularly that branch of
it which we have practised together in our bowling-green, has no
object but to shorten the strides of Ambition, and intrench the
lives and fortunes of the few, from the plunderings of the
many&mdash;whenever that drum beats in our ears, I trust, corporal,
we shall neither of us want so much humanity and fellow-feeling, as
to face about and march.</p>
<p>In pronouncing this, my uncle Toby faced about, and march'd
firmly as at the head of his company&mdash;and the faithful
corporal, shouldering his stick, and striking his hand upon his
coat-skirt as he took his first step&mdash;march'd close behind him
down the avenue.</p>
<p>&mdash;Now what can their two noddles be about? cried my father
to my mother&mdash;by all that's strange, they are besieging Mrs.
Wadman in form, and are marching round her house to mark out the
lines of circumvallation.</p>
<p>I dare say, quoth my mother&mdash;But stop, dear Sir&mdash;for
what my mother dared to say upon the occasion&mdash;and what my
father did say upon it&mdash;with her replies and his rejoinders,
shall be read, perused, paraphrased, commented, and descanted
upon&mdash;or to say it all in a word, shall be thumb'd over by
Posterity in a chapter apart&mdash;I say, by Posterity&mdash;and
care not, if I repeat the word again&mdash;for what has this book
done more than the Legation of Moses, or the Tale of a Tub, that it
may not swim down the gutter of Time along with them?</p>
<p>I will not argue the matter: Time wastes too fast: every letter
I trace tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen: the days
and hours of it, more precious, my dear Jenny! than the rubies
about thy neck, are flying over our heads like light clouds of a
windy day, never to return more&mdash;every thing presses
on&mdash;whilst thou art twisting that lock,&mdash;see! it grows
grey; and every time I kiss thy hand to bid adieu, and every
absence which follows it, are preludes to that eternal separation
which we are shortly to make.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Heaven have mercy upon us both!</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXIX.</h2>
<p>My mother had gone with her left arm twisted in my father's
right, till they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall,
where Doctor Slop was overthrown by Obadiah on the coach-horse: as
this was directly opposite to the front of Mrs. Wadman's house,
when my father came to it, he gave a look across; and seeing my
uncle Toby and the corporal within ten paces of the door, he turn'd
about&mdash;'Let us just stop a moment, quoth my father, and see
with what ceremonies my brother Toby and his man Trim make their
first entry&mdash;it will not detain us, added my father, a single
minute:'</p>
<p>&mdash;No matter, if it be ten minutes, quoth my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;It will not detain us half one; said my father.</p>
<p>The corporal was just then setting in with the story of his
brother Tom and the Jew's widow: the story went on&mdash;and
on&mdash;it had episodes in it&mdash;it came back, and went
on&mdash;and on again; there was no end of it&mdash;the reader
found it very long&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;G.. help my father! he pish'd fifty times at every new
attitude, and gave the corporal's stick, with all its flourishings
and danglings, to as many devils as chose to accept of them.</p>
<p>When issues of events like these my father is waiting for, are
hanging in the scales of fate, the mind has the advantage of
changing the principle of expectation three times, without which it
would not have power to see it out.</p>
<p>Curiosity governs the first moment; and the second moment is all
oeconomy to justify the expence of the first&mdash;and for the
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth moments, and so on to the day of
judgment&mdash;'tis a point of Honour.</p>
<p>I need not be told, that the ethic writers have assigned this
all to Patience; but that Virtue, methinks, has extent of dominion
sufficient of her own, and enough to do in it, without invading the
few dismantled castles which Honour has left him upon the
earth.</p>
<p>My father stood it out as well as he could with these three
auxiliaries to the end of Trim's story; and from thence to the end
of my uncle Toby's panegyrick upon arms, in the chapter following
it; when seeing, that instead of marching up to Mrs. Wadman's door,
they both faced about and march'd down the avenue diametrically
opposite to his expectation&mdash;he broke out at once with that
little subacid soreness of humour, which, in certain situations,
distinguished his character from that of all other men.</p>

<h3>&mdash;'Now what can their two noddles be about?' cried my
father...&amp;c....</h3>
<p>I dare say, said my mother, they are making
fortifications&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Not on Mrs. Wadman's premises! cried my father, stepping
back&mdash;</p>
<p>I suppose not: quoth my mother.</p>
<p>I wish, said my father, raising his voice, the whole science of
fortification at the devil, with all its trumpery of saps, mines,
blinds, gabions, fausse-brays and cuvetts&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;They are foolish things&mdash;said my mother.</p>
<p>Now she had a way, which, by the bye, I would this moment give
away my purple jerkin, and my yellow slippers into the bargain, if
some of your reverences would imitate&mdash;and that was, never to
refuse her assent and consent to any proposition my father laid
before her, merely because she did not understand it, or had no
ideas of the principal word or term of art, upon which the tenet or
proposition rolled. She contented herself with doing all that her
godfathers and godmothers promised for her&mdash;but no more; and
so would go on using a hard word twenty years together&mdash;and
replying to it too, if it was a verb, in all its moods and tenses,
without giving herself any trouble to enquire about it.</p>
<p>This was an eternal source of misery to my father, and broke the
neck, at the first setting out, of more good dialogues between
them, than could have done the most petulant
contradiction&mdash;the few which survived were the better for the
cuvetts&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;'They are foolish things;' said my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;Particularly the cuvetts; replied my father.</p>
<p>'Tis enough&mdash;he tasted the sweet of triumph&mdash;and went
on.</p>
<p>&mdash;Not that they are, properly speaking, Mrs. Wadman's
premises, said my father, partly correcting himself&mdash;because
she is but tenant for life&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;That makes a great difference&mdash;said my
mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;In a fool's head, replied my father&mdash;</p>
<p>Unless she should happen to have a child&mdash;said my
mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But she must persuade my brother Toby first to get her
one&mdash;</p>
<p>To be sure, Mr. Shandy, quoth my mother.</p>
<p>&mdash;Though if it comes to persuasion&mdash;said my
father&mdash;Lord have mercy upon them.</p>
<p>Amen: said my mother, piano.</p>
<p>Amen: cried my father, fortissime.</p>
<p>Amen: said my mother again&mdash;but with such a sighing cadence
of personal pity at the end of it, as discomfited every fibre about
my father&mdash;he instantly took out his almanack; but before he
could untie it, Yorick's congregation coming out of church, became
a full answer to one half of his business with it&mdash;and my
mother telling him it was a sacrament day&mdash;left him as little
in doubt, as to the other part&mdash;He put his almanack into his
pocket.</p>

not have returned home with a more embarrassed look.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXI.</h2>
<p>Upon looking back from the end of the last chapter, and
surveying the texture of what has been wrote, it is necessary, that
upon this page and the three following, a good quantity of
heterogeneous matter be inserted to keep up that just balance
betwixt wisdom and folly, without which a book would not hold
together a single year: nor is it a poor creeping digression (which
but for the name of, a man might continue as well going on in the
king's highway) which will do the business&mdash;no; if it is to be
a digression, it must be a good frisky one, and upon a frisky
subject too, where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught,
but by rebound.</p>
<p>The only difficulty, is raising powers suitable to the nature of
the service: Fancy is capricious&mdash;Wit must not be searched
for&mdash;and Pleasantry (good-natured slut as she is) will not
come in at a call, was an empire to be laid at her feet.</p>
<p>&mdash;The best way for a man, is to say his prayers&mdash;</p>
<p>Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as
well ghostly as bodily&mdash;for that purpose, he will find himself
rather worse after he has said them than before&mdash;for other
purposes, better.</p>
<p>For my own part, there is not a way either moral or mechanical
under heaven that I could think of, which I have not taken with
myself in this case: sometimes by addressing myself directly to the
soul herself, and arguing the point over and over again with her
upon the extent of her own faculties&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I never could make them an inch the wider&mdash;</p>
<p>Then by changing my system, and trying what could be made of it
upon the body, by temperance, soberness, and chastity: These are
good, quoth I, in themselves&mdash;they are good,
absolutely;&mdash;they are good, relatively;&mdash;they are good
for health&mdash;they are good for happiness in this
world&mdash;they are good for happiness in the next&mdash;</p>
<p>In short, they were good for every thing but the thing wanted;
and there they were good for nothing, but to leave the soul just as
heaven made it: as for the theological virtues of faith and hope,
they give it courage; but then that snivelling virtue of Meekness
(as my father would always call it) takes it quite away again, so
you are exactly where you started.</p>
<p>Now in all common and ordinary cases, there is nothing which I
have found to answer so well as this&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Certainly, if there is any dependence upon Logic, and
that I am not blinded by self-love, there must be something of true
genius about me, merely upon this symptom of it, that I do not know
what envy is: for never do I hit upon any invention or device which
tendeth to the furtherance of good writing, but I instantly make it
public; willing that all mankind should write as well as
myself.</p>
<p>&mdash;Which they certainly will, when they think as little.</p>

<br /></div>
<h2>Chapter 4.LXXII.</h2>
<p>Now in ordinary cases, that is, when I am only stupid, and the
thoughts rise heavily and pass gummous through my pen&mdash;</p>
<p>Or that I am got, I know not how, into a cold unmetaphorical
vein of infamous writing, and cannot take a plumb-lift out of it
for my soul; so must be obliged to go on writing like a Dutch
commentator to the end of the chapter, unless something be
done&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I never stand conferring with pen and ink one moment; for
if a pinch of snuff, or a stride or two across the room will not do
the business for me&mdash;I take a razor at once; and having tried
the edge of it upon the palm of my hand, without further ceremony,
except that of first lathering my beard, I shave it off; taking
care only if I do leave a hair, that it be not a grey one: this
done, I change my shirt&mdash;put on a better coat&mdash;send for
my last wig&mdash;put my topaz ring upon my finger; and in a word,
dress myself from one end to the other of me, after my best
fashion.</p>
<p>Now the devil in hell must be in it, if this does not do: for
consider, Sir, as every man chuses to be present at the shaving of
his own beard (though there is no rule without an exception), and
unavoidably sits over-against himself the whole time it is doing,
in case he has a hand in it&mdash;the Situation, like all others,
has notions of her own to put into the brain.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I maintain it, the conceits of a rough-bearded man, are
seven years more terse and juvenile for one single operation; and
if they did not run a risk of being quite shaved away, might be
carried up by continual shavings, to the highest pitch of
sublimity&mdash;How Homer could write with so long a beard, I don't
know&mdash;and as it makes against my hypothesis, I as little
care&mdash;But let us return to the Toilet.</p>
<p>Ludovicus Sorbonensis makes this entirely an affair of the body
(Greek) as he calls it&mdash;but he is deceived: the soul and body
are joint-sharers in every thing they get: A man cannot dress, but
his ideas get cloth'd at the same time; and if he dresses like a
gentleman, every one of them stands presented to his imagination,
genteelized along with him&mdash;so that he has nothing to do, but
take his pen, and write like himself.</p>
<p>For this cause, when your honours and reverences would know
whether I writ clean and fit to be read, you will be able to judge
full as well by looking into my Laundress's bill, as my book: there
is one single month in which I can make it appear, that I dirtied
one and thirty shirts with clean writing; and after all, was more
abus'd, cursed, criticis'd, and confounded, and had more mystic
heads shaken at me, for what I had wrote in that one month, than in
all the other months of that year put together.</p>
<p>&mdash;But their honours and reverences had not seen my
bills.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXIII.</h2>
<p>As I never had any intention of beginning the Digression, I am
making all this preparation for, till I come to the 74th
chapter&mdash;I have this chapter to put to whatever use I think
proper&mdash;I have twenty this moment ready for it&mdash;I could
write my chapter of Button-holes in it&mdash;</p>
<p>Or my chapter of Pishes, which should follow them&mdash;</p>
<p>Or my chapter of Knots, in case their reverences have done with
them&mdash;they might lead me into mischief: the safest way is to
follow the track of the learned, and raise objections against what
I have been writing, tho' I declare before-hand, I know no more
than my heels how to answer them.</p>
<p>And first, it may be said, there is a pelting kind of
thersitical satire, as black as the very ink 'tis wrote
with&mdash;(and by the bye, whoever says so, is indebted to the
muster-master general of the Grecian army, for suffering the name
of so ugly and foul-mouth'd a man as Thersites to continue upon his
roll&mdash;for it has furnish'd him with an epithet)&mdash;in these
productions he will urge, all the personal washings and scrubbings
upon earth do a sinking genius no sort of good&mdash;but just the
contrary, inasmuch as the dirtier the fellow is, the better
generally he succeeds in it.</p>
<p>To this, I have no other answer&mdash;at least ready&mdash;but
that the Archbishop of Benevento wrote his nasty Romance of the
Galatea, as all the world knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and
purple pair of breeches; and that the penance set him of writing a
commentary upon the book of the Revelations, as severe as it was
look'd upon by one part of the world, was far from being deem'd so,
by the other, upon the single account of that Investment.</p>
<p>Another objection, to all this remedy, is its want of
universality; forasmuch as the shaving part of it, upon which so
much stress is laid, by an unalterable law of nature excludes one
half of the species entirely from its use: all I can say is, that
female writers, whether of England, or of France, must e'en go
without it&mdash;</p>
<p>As for the Spanish ladies&mdash;I am in no sort of
distress&mdash;</p>

<p>When my uncle Toby and the corporal had marched down to the
bottom of the avenue, they recollected their business lay the other
way; so they faced about and marched up straight to Mrs. Wadman's
door.</p>
<p>I warrant your honour; said the corporal, touching his
Montero-cap with his hand, as he passed him in order to give a
knock at the door&mdash;My uncle Toby, contrary to his invariable
way of treating his faithful servant, said nothing good or bad: the
truth was, he had not altogether marshal'd his ideas; he wish'd for
another conference, and as the corporal was mounting up the three
steps before the door&mdash;he hem'd twice&mdash;a portion of my
uncle Toby's most modest spirits fled, at each expulsion, towards
the corporal; he stood with the rapper of the door suspended for a
full minute in his hand, he scarce knew why. Bridget stood perdue
within, with her finger and her thumb upon the latch, benumb'd with
expectation; and Mrs. Wadman, with an eye ready to be deflowered
again, sat breathless behind the window-curtain of her bed-chamber,
watching their approach.</p>
<p>Trim! said my uncle Toby&mdash;but as he articulated the word,
the minute expired, and Trim let fall the rapper.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby perceiving that all hopes of a conference were
knock'd on the head by it&mdash;whistled Lillabullero.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Bridget's finger and thumb were upon the latch, the
corporal did not knock as often as perchance your honour's
taylor&mdash;I might have taken my example something nearer home;
for I owe mine, some five and twenty pounds at least, and wonder at
the man's patience&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But this is nothing at all to the world: only 'tis a
cursed thing to be in debt; and there seems to be a fatality in the
exchequers of some poor princes, particularly those of our house,
which no Economy can bind down in irons: for my own part, I'm
persuaded there is not any one prince, prelate, pope, or potentate,
great or small upon earth, more desirous in his heart of keeping
straight with the world than I am&mdash;or who takes more likely
means for it. I never give above half a guinea&mdash;or walk with
boots&mdash;or cheapen tooth-picks&mdash;or lay out a shilling upon
a band-box the year round; and for the six months I'm in the
country, I'm upon so small a scale, that with all the good temper
in the world, I outdo Rousseau, a bar length&mdash;for I keep
neither man or boy, or horse, or cow, or dog, or cat, or any thing
that can eat or drink, except a thin poor piece of a Vestal (to
keep my fire in), and who has generally as bad an appetite as
myself&mdash;but if you think this makes a philosopher of
me&mdash;I would not, my good people! give a rush for your
judgments.</p>

pale&mdash;blush'd slightly again&mdash;recover'd her natural
colour&mdash;blush'd worse than ever; which, for the sake of the

passage&mdash;</p>

Toby&mdash;I saw it there, an' please your honour, this morning,

my uncle Toby, and bring it into the parlour.</p>
<p>The corporal did not approve of the orders, but most cheerfully
obeyed them. The first was not an act of his will&mdash;the second
was; so he put on his Montero-cap, and went as fast as his lame
knee would let him. My uncle Toby returned into the parlour, and
sat himself down again upon the sopha.</p>

<p>As there are fifty different ends (counting all ends in&mdash;as
well civil as religious) for which a woman takes a husband, the
first sets about and carefully weighs, then separates and
distinguishes in her mind, which of all that number of ends is
hers; then by discourse, enquiry, argumentation, and inference, she
investigates and finds out whether she has got hold of the right
one&mdash;and if she has&mdash;then, by pulling it gently this way
and that way, she further forms a judgment, whether it will not
break in the drawing.</p>
<p>The imagery under which Slawkenbergius impresses this upon the
reader's fancy, in the beginning of his third Decad, is so
ludicrous, that the honour I bear the sex, will not suffer me to
quote it&mdash;otherwise it is not destitute of humour.</p>
<p>'She first, saith Slawkenbergius, stops the asse, and holding
his halter in her left hand (lest he should get away) she thrusts
her right hand into the very bottom of his pannier to search for
it&mdash;For what?&mdash;you'll not know the sooner, quoth
Slawkenbergius, for interrupting me&mdash;</p>
<p>'I have nothing, good Lady, but empty bottles;' says the
asse.</p>
<p>'I'm loaded with tripes;' says the second.</p>
<p>&mdash;And thou art little better, quoth she to the third; for
nothing is there in thy panniers but trunk-hose and
pantofles&mdash;and so to the fourth and fifth, going on one by one
through the whole string, till coming to the asse which carries it,
she turns the pannier upside down, looks at it&mdash;considers
it&mdash;samples it&mdash;measures it&mdash;stretches it&mdash;wets
it&mdash;dries it&mdash;then takes her teeth both to the warp and
weft of it.</p>
<p>&mdash;Of what? for the love of Christ!</p>
<p>I am determined, answered Slawkenbergius, that all the powers
upon earth shall never wring that secret from my breast.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXI.</h2>
<p>We live in a world beset on all sides with mysteries and
riddles&mdash;and so 'tis no matter&mdash;else it seems strange,
that Nature, who makes every thing so well to answer its
destination, and seldom or never errs, unless for pastime, in
giving such forms and aptitudes to whatever passes through her
hands, that whether she designs for the plough, the caravan, the
cart&mdash;or whatever other creature she models, be it but an
asse's foal, you are sure to have the thing you wanted; and yet at
the same time should so eternally bungle it as she does, in making
so simple a thing as a married man.</p>
<p>Whether it is in the choice of the clay&mdash;or that it is
frequently spoiled in the baking; by an excess of which a husband
may turn out too crusty (you know) on one hand&mdash;or not enough
so, through defect of heat, on the other&mdash;or whether this
great Artificer is not so attentive to the little Platonic
exigences of that part of the species, for whose use she is
fabricating this&mdash;or that her Ladyship sometimes scarce knows
what sort of a husband will do&mdash;I know not: we will discourse
about it after supper.</p>
<p>It is enough, that neither the observation itself, or the
reasoning upon it, are at all to the purpose&mdash;but rather
against it; since with regard to my uncle Toby's fitness for the
marriage state, nothing was ever better: she had formed him of the
best and kindliest clay&mdash;had temper'd it with her own milk,
and breathed into it the sweetest spirit&mdash;she had made him all
gentle, generous, and humane&mdash;she had filled his heart with
trust and confidence, and disposed every passage which led to it,
for the communication of the tenderest offices&mdash;she had
moreover considered the other causes for which matrimony was
ordained&mdash;</p>
<p>And accordingly....</p>
<p>The Donation was not defeated by my uncle Toby's wound.</p>
<p>Now this last article was somewhat apocryphal; and the Devil,
who is the great disturber of our faiths in this world, had raised
scruples in Mrs. Wadman's brain about it; and like a true devil as
he was, had done his own work at the same time, by turning my uncle
Toby's Virtue thereupon into nothing but empty bottles, tripes,
trunk-hose, and pantofles.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXII.</h2>
<p>Mrs. Bridget had pawn'd all the little stock of honour a poor
chamber-maid was worth in the world, that she would get to the
bottom of the affair in ten days; and it was built upon one of the
most concessible postulata in nature: namely, that whilst my uncle
Toby was making love to her mistress, the corporal could find
nothing better to do, than make love to her&mdash;'And I'll let him
as much as he will, said Bridget, to get it out of him.'</p>
<p>Friendship has two garments; an outer and an under one. Bridget
was serving her mistress's interests in the one&mdash;and doing the
thing which most pleased herself in the other: so had as many
stakes depending upon my uncle Toby's wound, as the Devil
himself&mdash;Mrs. Wadman had but one&mdash;and as it possibly
might be her last (without discouraging Mrs. Bridget, or
discrediting her talents) was determined to play her cards
herself.</p>
<p>She wanted not encouragement: a child might have look'd into his
hand&mdash;there was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing
out what trumps he had&mdash;with such an unmistrusting ignorance
of the ten-ace&mdash;and so naked and defenceless did he sit upon
the same sopha with widow Wadman, that a generous heart would have
wept to have won the game of him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXIII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;And the story too&mdash;if you please: for though I have
all along been hastening towards this part of it, with so much
earnest desire, as well knowing it to be the choicest morsel of
what I had to offer to the world, yet now that I am got to it, any
one is welcome to take my pen, and go on with the story for me that
will&mdash;I see the difficulties of the descriptions I'm going to
give&mdash;and feel my want of powers.</p>
<p>It is one comfort at least to me, that I lost some fourscore
ounces of blood this week in a most uncritical fever which attacked
me at the beginning of this chapter; so that I have still some
hopes remaining, it may be more in the serous or globular parts of
the blood, than in the subtile aura of the brain&mdash;be it which
it will&mdash;an Invocation can do no hurt&mdash;and I leave the
affair entirely to the invoked, to inspire or to inject me
according as he sees good.</p>
<p>The Invocation.</p>
<p>Gentle Spirit of sweetest humour, who erst did sit upon the easy
pen of my beloved Cervantes; Thou who glidedst daily through his
lattice, and turned'st the twilight of his prison into noon-day
brightness by thy presence&mdash;tinged'st his little urn of water
with heaven-sent nectar, and all the time he wrote of Sancho and
his master, didst cast thy mystic mantle o'er his wither'd stump
(He lost his hand at the battle of Lepanto.), and wide extended it
to all the evils of his life&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Turn in hither, I beseech thee!&mdash;behold these
breeches!&mdash;they are all I have in world&mdash;that piteous
rent was given them at Lyons&mdash;</p>
<p>My shirts! see what a deadly schism has happen'd amongst
'em&mdash;for the laps are in Lombardy, and the rest of 'em
here&mdash;I never had but six, and a cunning gypsey of a laundress
at Milan cut me off the fore-laps of five&mdash;To do her justice,
she did it with some consideration&mdash;for I was returning out of
Italy.</p>
<p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, and a pistol tinder-box which
was moreover filch'd from me at Sienna, and twice that I pay'd five
Pauls for two hard eggs, once at Raddicoffini, and a second time at
Capua&mdash;I do not think a journey through France and Italy,
provided a man keeps his temper all the way, so bad a thing as some
people would make you believe: there must be ups and downs, or how
the duce should we get into vallies where Nature spreads so many
tables of entertainment.&mdash;'Tis nonsense to imagine they will
lend you their voitures to be shaken to pieces for nothing; and
unless you pay twelve sous for greasing your wheels, how should the
poor peasant get butter to his bread?&mdash;We really expect too
much&mdash;and for the livre or two above par for your suppers and
bed&mdash;at the most they are but one shilling and ninepence
halfpenny&mdash;who would embroil their philosophy for it? for
heaven's and for your own sake, pay it&mdash;pay it with both hands
open, rather than leave Disappointment sitting drooping upon the
eye of your fair Hostess and her Damsels in the gate-way, at your
departure&mdash;and besides, my dear Sir, you get a sisterly kiss
of each of 'em worth a pound&mdash;at least I did&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;For my uncle Toby's amours running all the way in my
head, they had the same effect upon me as if they had been my
own&mdash;I was in the most perfect state of bounty and good-will;
and felt the kindliest harmony vibrating within me, with every
oscillation of the chaise alike; so that whether the roads were
rough or smooth, it made no difference; every thing I saw or had to
do with, touch'd upon some secret spring either of sentiment or
rapture.</p>
<p>&mdash;They were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I
instantly let down the fore-glass to hear them more
distinctly&mdash;'Tis Maria; said the postillion, observing I was
listening&mdash;Poor Maria, continued he (leaning his body on one
side to let me see her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is
sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her
little goat beside her.</p>
<p>The young fellow utter'd this with an accent and a look so
perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow,
I would give him a four-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to
Moulins&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;And who is poor Maria? said I.</p>
<p>The love and piety of all the villages around us; said the
postillion&mdash;it is but three years ago, that the sun did not
shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and amiable a maid; and better
fate did Maria deserve, than to have her Banns forbid, by the
intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them&mdash;</p>
<p>He was going on, when Maria, who had made a short pause, put the
pipe to her mouth, and began the air again&mdash;they were the same
notes;&mdash;yet were ten times sweeter: It is the evening service
to the Virgin, said the young man&mdash;but who has taught her to
play it&mdash;or how she came by her pipe, no one knows; we think
that heaven has assisted her in both; for ever since she has been
unsettled in her mind, it seems her only consolation&mdash;she has
never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that service
upon it almost night and day.</p>
<p>The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and
natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering something in
his face above his condition, and should have sifted out his
history, had not poor Maria taken such full possession of me.</p>
<p>We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was
sitting: she was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two
tresses, drawn up into a silk-net, with a few olive leaves twisted
a little fantastically on one side&mdash;she was beautiful; and if
ever I felt the full force of an honest heart-ache, it was the
moment I saw her&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;God help her! poor damsel! above a hundred masses, said
the postillion, have been said in the several parish churches and
convents around, for her,&mdash;but without effect; we have still
hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, that the Virgin at
last will restore her to herself; but her parents, who know her
best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses are lost
for ever.</p>
<p>As the postillion spoke this, Maria made a cadence so
melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprung out of the
chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt her and her
goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Maria look'd wistfully for some time at me, and then at her
goat&mdash;and then at me&mdash;and then at her goat again, and so
on, alternately&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Well, Maria, said I softly&mdash;What resemblance do you
find?</p>
<p>I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from
the humblest conviction of what a Beast man is,&mdash;that I asked
the question; and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable
pleasantry in the venerable presence of Misery, to be entitled to
all the wit that ever Rabelais scatter'd&mdash;and yet I own my
heart smote me, and that I so smarted at the very idea of it, that
I swore I would set up for Wisdom, and utter grave sentences the
rest of my days&mdash;and never&mdash;never attempt again to commit
mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to live.</p>
<p>As for writing nonsense to them&mdash;I believe there was a
reserve&mdash;but that I leave to the world.</p>
<p>Adieu, Maria!&mdash;adieu, poor hapless damsel!&mdash;some time,
but not now, I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips&mdash;but I
was deceived; for that moment she took her pipe and told me such a
tale of woe with it, that I rose up, and with broken and irregular
steps walk'd softly to my chaise.</p>
<p>&mdash;What an excellent inn at Moulins!</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXIV.</h2>
<p>When we have got to the end of this chapter (but not before) we
must all turn back to the two blank chapters, on the account of
which my honour has lain bleeding this half hour&mdash;I stop it,
by pulling off one of my yellow slippers and throwing it with all
my violence to the opposite side of my room, with a declaration at
the heel of it&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;That whatever resemblance it may bear to half the
chapters which are written in the world, or for aught I know may be
now writing in it&mdash;that it was as casual as the foam of Zeuxis
his horse; besides, I look upon a chapter which has only nothing in
it, with respect; and considering what worse things there are in
the world&mdash;That it is no way a proper subject for
satire&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Why then was it left so? And here without staying for my
reply, shall I be called as many blockheads, numsculs, doddypoles,
dunderheads, ninny-hammers, goosecaps, joltheads, nincompoops, and
sh..t-a-beds&mdash;and other unsavoury appellations, as ever the
cake-bakers of Lerne cast in the teeth of King Garangantan's
shepherds&mdash;And I'll let them do it, as Bridget said, as much
as they please; for how was it possible they should foresee the
necessity I was under of writing the 84th chapter of my book,
before the 77th, &amp;c?</p>
<p>&mdash;So I don't take it amiss&mdash;All I wish is, that it may
be a lesson to the world, 'to let people tell their stories their
own way.'</p>
<p>The Seventy-seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Bridget opened the door before the corporal had well
given the rap, the interval betwixt that and my uncle Toby's
introduction into the parlour, was so short, that Mrs. Wadman had
but just time to get from behind the curtain&mdash;lay a Bible upon
the table, and advance a step or two towards the door to receive
him.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby saluted Mrs. Wadman, after the manner in which
women were saluted by men in the year of our Lord God one thousand
seven hundred and thirteen&mdash;then facing about, he march'd up
abreast with her to the sopha, and in three plain
words&mdash;though not before he was sat down&mdash;nor after he
was sat down&mdash;but as he was sitting down, told her, 'he was in
love'&mdash;so that my uncle Toby strained himself more in the
declaration than he needed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wadman naturally looked down, upon a slit she had been
darning up in her apron, in expectation every moment, that my uncle
Toby would go on; but having no talents for amplification, and Love
moreover of all others being a subject of which he was the least a
master&mdash;When he had told Mrs. Wadman once that he loved her,
he let it alone, and left the matter to work after its own way.</p>
<p>My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle
Toby's, as he falsely called it, and would often say, that could
his brother Toby to his processe have added but a pipe of
tobacco&mdash;he had wherewithal to have found his way, if there
was faith in a Spanish proverb, towards the hearts of half the
women upon the globe.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant; nor will I
presume to extract more from it, than a condemnation of an error
which the bulk of the world lie under&mdash;but the French, every
one of 'em to a man, who believe in it, almost as much as the Real
Presence, 'That talking of love, is making it.'</p>
<p>&mdash;I would as soon set about making a black-pudding by the
same receipt.</p>
<p>Let us go on: Mrs. Wadman sat in expectation my uncle Toby would
do so, to almost the first pulsation of that minute, wherein
silence on one side or the other, generally becomes indecent: so
edging herself a little more towards him, and raising up her eyes,
sub blushing, as she did it&mdash;she took up the gauntlet&mdash;or
the discourse (if you like it better) and communed with my uncle
Toby, thus:</p>
<p>The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth Mrs.
Wadman, are very great. I suppose so&mdash;said my uncle Toby: and
therefore when a person, continued Mrs. Wadman, is so much at his
ease as you are&mdash;so happy, captain Shandy, in yourself, your
friends and your amusements&mdash;I wonder, what reasons can
incline you to the state&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;They are written, quoth my uncle Toby, in the
Common-Prayer Book.</p>
<p>Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily, and kept within his
depth, leaving Mrs. Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she
pleased.</p>
<p>&mdash;As for children&mdash;said Mrs. Wadman&mdash;though a
principal end perhaps of the institution, and the natural wish, I
suppose, of every parent&mdash;yet do not we all find, they are
certain sorrows, and very uncertain comforts? and what is there,
dear sir, to pay one for the heart-achs&mdash;what compensation for
the many tender and disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and
defenceless mother who brings them into life? I declare, said my
uncle Toby, smit with pity, I know of none; unless it be the
pleasure which it has pleased God&mdash;</p>
<p>A fiddlestick! quoth she.</p>

<br />
<br /></div>
<h2>Chapter 4.the Seventy-eighth.</h2>
<p>Now there are such an infinitude of notes, tunes, cants, chants,
airs, looks, and accents with which the word fiddlestick may be
pronounced in all such causes as this, every one of 'em impressing
a sense and meaning as different from the other, as dirt from
cleanliness&mdash;That Casuists (for it is an affair of conscience
on that score) reckon up no less than fourteen thousand in which
you may do either right or wrong.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wadman hit upon the fiddlestick, which summoned up all my
uncle Toby's modest blood into his cheeks&mdash;so feeling within
himself that he had somehow or other got beyond his depth, he stopt
short; and without entering further either into the pains or
pleasures of matrimony, he laid his hand upon his heart, and made
an offer to take them as they were, and share them along with
her.</p>
<p>When my uncle Toby had said this, he did not care to say it
again; so casting his eye upon the Bible which Mrs. Wadman had laid
upon the table, he took it up; and popping, dear soul! upon a
passage in it, of all others the most interesting to
him&mdash;which was the siege of Jericho&mdash;he set himself to
read it over&mdash;leaving his proposal of marriage, as he had done
his declaration of love, to work with her after its own way. Now it
wrought neither as an astringent or a loosener; nor like opium, or
bark, or mercury, or buckthorn, or any one drug which nature had
bestowed upon the world&mdash;in short, it work'd not at all in
her; and the cause of that was, that there was something working
there before&mdash;Babbler that I am! I have anticipated what it
was a dozen times; but there is fire still in the
subject&mdash;allons.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXV.</h2>
<p>It is natural for a perfect stranger who is going from London to
Edinburgh, to enquire before he sets out, how many miles to York;
which is about the half way&mdash;nor does any body wonder, if he
goes on and asks about the corporation, &amp;c....</p>
<p>It was just as natural for Mrs. Wadman, whose first husband was
all his time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know how far
from the hip to the groin; and how far she was likely to suffer
more or less in her feelings, in the one case than in the
other.</p>
<p>She had accordingly read Drake's anatomy from one end to the
other. She had peeped into Wharton upon the brain, and borrowed
Graaf (This must be a mistake in Mr. Shandy; for Graaf wrote upon
the pancreatick juice, and the parts of generation.) upon the bones
and muscles; but could make nothing of it.</p>
<p>She had reason'd likewise from her own powers&mdash;laid down
theorems&mdash;drawn consequences, and come to no conclusion.</p>
<p>To clear up all, she had twice asked Doctor Slop, 'if poor
captain Shandy was ever likely to recover of his wound&mdash;?'</p>
<p>&mdash;He is recovered, Doctor Slop would say&mdash;</p>
<p>What! quite?</p>
<p>Quite: madam&mdash;</p>
<p>But what do you mean by a recovery? Mrs. Wadman would say.</p>
<p>Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and so Mrs.
Wadman could get no knowledge: in short, there was no way to
extract it, but from my uncle Toby himself.</p>
<p>There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which
lulls Suspicion to rest&mdash;and I am half persuaded the serpent
got pretty near it, in his discourse with Eve; for the propensity
in the sex to be deceived could not be so great, that she should
have boldness to hold chat with the devil, without it&mdash;But
there is an accent of humanity&mdash;how shall I describe
it?&mdash;'tis an accent which covers the part with a garment, and
gives the enquirer a right to be as particular with it, as your
body-surgeon.</p>
<p>'&mdash;Was it without remission?&mdash;</p>
<p>'&mdash;Was it more tolerable in bed?</p>
<p>'&mdash;Could he lie on both sides alike with it?</p>
<p>'&mdash;Was he able to mount a horse?</p>
<p>'&mdash;Was motion bad for it?' et caetera, were so tenderly
spoke to, and so directed towards my uncle Toby's heart, that every
item of them sunk ten times deeper into it than the evils
themselves&mdash;but when Mrs. Wadman went round about by Namur to
get at my uncle Toby's groin; and engaged him to attack the point
of the advanced counterscarp, and pele mele with the Dutch to take
the counterguard of St. Roch sword in hand&mdash;and then with
tender notes playing upon his ear, led him all bleeding by the hand
out of the trench, wiping her eye, as he was carried to his
tent&mdash;Heaven! Earth! Sea!&mdash;all was lifted up&mdash;the
springs of nature rose above their levels&mdash;an angel of mercy
sat besides him on the sopha&mdash;his heart glow'd with
fire&mdash;and had he been worth a thousand, he had lost every
heart of them to Mrs. Wadman.</p>
<p>&mdash;And whereabouts, dear sir, quoth Mrs. Wadman, a little
categorically, did you receive this sad blow?&mdash;In asking this
question, Mrs. Wadman gave a slight glance towards the waistband of
my uncle Toby's red plush breeches, expecting naturally, as the
shortest reply to it, that my uncle Toby would lay his fore-finger
upon the place&mdash;It fell out otherwise&mdash;for my uncle Toby
having got his wound before the gate of St. Nicolas, in one of the
traverses of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the
demibastion of St. Roch; he could at any time stick a pin upon the
identical spot of ground where he was standing when the stone
struck him: this struck instantly upon my uncle Toby's
sensorium&mdash;and with it, struck his large map of the town and
citadel of Namur and its environs, which he had purchased and
pasted down upon a board, by the corporal's aid, during his long
illness&mdash;it had lain with other military lumber in the garret
ever since, and accordingly the corporal was detached to the garret
to fetch it.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby measured off thirty toises, with Mrs. Wadman's
scissars, from the returning angle before the gate of St. Nicolas;
and with such a virgin modesty laid her finger upon the place, that
the goddess of Decency, if then in being&mdash;if not, 'twas her
shade&mdash;shook her head, and with a finger wavering across her
eyes&mdash;forbid her to explain the mistake.</p>
<p>Unhappy Mrs. Wadman!</p>
<p>&mdash;For nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but
an apostrophe to thee&mdash;but my heart tells me, that in such a
crisis an apostrophe is but an insult in disguise, and ere I would
offer one to a woman in distress&mdash;let the chapter go to the
devil; provided any damn'd critic in keeping will be but at the
trouble to take it with him.</p>

<p>&mdash;And here is the Maes&mdash;and this is the Sambre; said
the corporal, pointing with his right hand extended a little
towards the map, and his left upon Mrs. Bridget's
shoulder&mdash;but not the shoulder next him&mdash;and this, said
he, is the town of Namur&mdash;and this the citadel&mdash;and there
lay the French&mdash;and here lay his honour and myself&mdash;and
in this cursed trench, Mrs. Bridget, quoth the corporal, taking her
by the hand, did he receive the wound which crush'd him so
miserably here.&mdash;In pronouncing which, he slightly press'd the
back of her hand towards the part he felt for&mdash;and let it
fall.</p>
<p>We thought, Mr. Trim, it had been more in the middle,&mdash;said
Mrs. Bridget&mdash;</p>
<p>That would have undone us for ever&mdash;said the corporal.</p>
<p>&mdash;And left my poor mistress undone too, said Bridget.</p>
<p>The corporal made no reply to the repartee, but by giving Mrs.
Bridget a kiss.</p>
<p>Come&mdash;come&mdash;said Bridget&mdash;holding the palm of her
left hand parallel to the plane of the horizon, and sliding the
fingers of the other over it, in a way which could not have been
done, had there been the least wart or protruberance&mdash;'Tis
every syllable of it false, cried the corporal, before she had half
finished the sentence&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I know it to be fact, said Bridget, from credible
witnesses.</p>
<p>&mdash;Upon my honour, said the corporal, laying his hand upon
his heart, and blushing, as he spoke, with honest
resentment&mdash;'tis a story, Mrs. Bridget, as false as
hell&mdash;Not, said Bridget, interrupting him, that either I or my
mistress care a halfpenny about it, whether 'tis so or
no&mdash;only that when one is married, one would chuse to have
such a thing by one at least&mdash;</p>
<p>It was somewhat unfortunate for Mrs. Bridget, that she had begun

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXVIII.</h2>
<p>It was like the momentary contest in the moist eye-lids of an
April morning, 'Whether Bridget should laugh or cry.'</p>
<p>She snatch'd up a rolling-pin&mdash;'twas ten to one, she had
laugh'd&mdash;</p>
<p>She laid it down&mdash;she cried; and had one single tear of 'em
but tasted of bitterness, full sorrowful would the corporal's heart
have been that he had used the argument; but the corporal
understood the sex, a quart major to a terce at least, better than
my uncle Toby, and accordingly he assailed Mrs. Bridget after this
manner.</p>
<p>I know, Mrs. Bridget, said the corporal, giving her a most
respectful kiss, that thou art good and modest by nature, and art
withal so generous a girl in thyself, that, if I know thee rightly,
thou would'st not wound an insect, much less the honour of so
gallant and worthy a soul as my master, wast thou sure to be made a
countess of&mdash;but thou hast been set on, and deluded, dear
Bridget, as is often a woman's case, 'to please others more than
themselves&mdash;'</p>
<p>Bridget's eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal
excited.</p>
<p>&mdash;Tell me&mdash;tell me, then, my dear Bridget, continued
the corporal, taking hold of her hand, which hung down dead by her
side,&mdash;and giving a second kiss&mdash;whose suspicion has
misled thee?</p>
<p>Bridget sobb'd a sob or two&mdash;then open'd her eyes&mdash;the
corporal wiped 'em with the bottom of her apron&mdash;she then
open'd her heart and told him all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.LXXXIX.</h2>
<p>My uncle Toby and the corporal had gone on separately with their
operations the greatest part of the campaign, and as effectually
cut off from all communication of what either the one or the other
had been doing, as if they had been separated from each other by
the Maes or the Sambre.</p>
<p>My uncle Toby, on his side, had presented himself every
afternoon in his red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and
sustained an infinity of attacks in them, without knowing them to
be attacks&mdash;and so had nothing to communicate&mdash;</p>
<p>The corporal, on his side, in taking Bridget, by it had gain'd
considerable advantages&mdash;and consequently had much to
communicate&mdash;but what were the advantages&mdash;as well as
what was the manner by which he had seiz'd them, required so nice
an historian, that the corporal durst not venture upon it; and as
sensible as he was of glory, would rather have been contented to
have gone bareheaded and without laurels for ever, than torture his
master's modesty for a single moment&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Best of honest and gallant servants!&mdash;But I have
apostrophiz'd thee, Trim! once before&mdash;and could I apotheosize
thee also (that is to say) with good company&mdash;I would do it
without ceremony in the very next page.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XC.</h2>
<p>Now my uncle Toby had one evening laid down his pipe upon the
table, and was counting over to himself upon his finger ends
(beginning at his thumb) all Mrs. Wadman's perfections one by one;
and happening two or three times together, either by omitting some,
or counting others twice over, to puzzle himself sadly before he
could get beyond his middle finger&mdash;Prithee, Trim! said he,
taking up his pipe again,&mdash;bring me a pen and ink: Trim
brought paper also.</p>
<p>Take a full sheet&mdash;Trim! said my uncle Toby, making a sign
with his pipe at the same time to take a chair and sit down close
by him at the table. The corporal obeyed&mdash;placed the paper
directly before him&mdash;took a pen, and dipp'd it in the ink.</p>
<p>&mdash;She has a thousand virtues, Trim! said my uncle
Toby&mdash;</p>
<p>Am I to set them down, an' please your honour? quoth the
corporal.</p>
<p>&mdash;But they must be taken in their ranks, replied my uncle
Toby; for of them all, Trim, that which wins me most, and which is
a security for all the rest, is the compassionate turn and singular
humanity of her character&mdash;I protest, added my uncle Toby,
looking up, as he protested it, towards the top of the
ceiling&mdash;That was I her brother, Trim, a thousand fold, she
could not make more constant or more tender enquiries after my
sufferings&mdash;though now no more.</p>
<p>The corporal made no reply to my uncle Toby's protestation, but
by a short cough&mdash;he dipp'd the pen a second time into the
inkhorn; and my uncle Toby, pointing with the end of his pipe as
close to the top of the sheet at the left hand corner of it, as he
could get it&mdash;the corporal wrote down the word
HUMANITY...thus.</p>
<p>Prithee, corporal, said my uncle Toby, as soon as Trim had done
it&mdash;how often does Mrs. Bridget enquire after the wound on the
cap of thy knee, which thou received'st at the battle of
Landen?</p>
<p>She never, an' please your honour, enquires after it at all.</p>
<p>That, corporal, said my uncle Toby, with all the triumph the
goodness of his nature would permit&mdash;That shews the difference
in the character of the mistress and maid&mdash;had the fortune of
war allotted the same mischance to me, Mrs. Wadman would have
enquired into every circumstance relating to it a hundred
times&mdash;She would have enquired, an' please your honour, ten
times as often about your honour's groin&mdash;The pain, Trim, is
equally excruciating,&mdash;and Compassion has as much to do with
the one as the other&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;God bless your honour! cried the corporal&mdash;what has
a woman's compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a man's
knee? had your honour's been shot into ten thousand splinters at
the affair of Landen, Mrs. Wadman would have troubled her head as
little about it as Bridget; because, added the corporal, lowering
his voice, and speaking very distinctly, as he assigned his
reason&mdash;</p>
<p>'The knee is such a distance from the main body&mdash;whereas
the groin, your honour knows, is upon the very curtain of the
place.'</p>
<p>My uncle Toby gave a long whistle&mdash;but in a note which
could scarce be heard across the table.</p>
<p>The corporal had advanced too far to retire&mdash;in three words
he told the rest&mdash;</p>
<p>My uncle Toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender, as
if it had been spun from the unravellings of a spider's
web&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Let us go to my brother Shandy's, said he.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.XCI.</h2>
<p>There will be just time, whilst my uncle Toby and Trim are
walking to my father's, to inform you that Mrs. Wadman had, some
moons before this, made a confident of my mother; and that Mrs.
Bridget, who had the burden of her own, as well as her mistress's
secret to carry, had got happily delivered of both to Susannah
behind the garden-wall.</p>
<p>As for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the
least bustle about&mdash;but Susannah was sufficient by herself for
all the ends and purposes you could possibly have, in exporting a
family secret; for she instantly imparted it by signs to
Jonathan&mdash;and Jonathan by tokens to the cook as she was
basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it with some kitchen-fat to
the postillion for a groat, who truck'd it with the dairy maid for
something of about the same value&mdash;and though whisper'd in the
hay-loft, Fame caught the notes with her brazen trumpet, and
sounded them upon the house-top&mdash;In a word, not an old woman
in the village or five miles round, who did not understand the
difficulties of my uncle Toby's siege, and what were the secret
articles which had delayed the surrender.&mdash;</p>
<p>My father, whose way was to force every event in nature into an
hypothesis, by which means never man crucified Truth at the rate he
did&mdash;had but just heard of the report as my uncle Toby set
out; and catching fire suddenly at the trespass done his brother by
it, was demonstrating to Yorick, notwithstanding my mother was
sitting by&mdash;not only, 'That the devil was in women, and that
the whole of the affair was lust;' but that every evil and disorder
in the world, of what kind or nature soever, from the first fall of
Adam, down to my uncle Toby's (inclusive), was owing one way or
other to the same unruly appetite.</p>
<p>Yorick was just bringing my father's hypothesis to some temper,
when my uncle Toby entering the room with marks of infinite
benevolence and forgiveness in his looks, my father's eloquence
re-kindled against the passion&mdash;and as he was not very nice in
the choice of his words when he was wroth&mdash;as soon as my uncle
Toby was seated by the fire, and had filled his pipe, my father
broke out in this manner.</p>

<br /></div>
<h2>Chapter 4.XCII.</h2>
<p>&mdash;That provision should be made for continuing the race of
so great, so exalted and godlike a Being as man&mdash;I am far from
denying&mdash;but philosophy speaks freely of every thing; and
therefore I still think and do maintain it to be a pity, that it
should be done by means of a passion which bends down the
faculties, and turns all the wisdom, contemplations, and operations
of the soul backwards&mdash;a passion, my dear, continued my
father, addressing himself to my mother, which couples and equals
wise men with fools, and makes us come out of our caverns and
hiding-places more like satyrs and four-footed beasts than men.</p>
<p>I know it will be said, continued my father (availing himself of
the Prolepsis), that in itself, and simply taken&mdash;like hunger,
or thirst, or sleep&mdash;'tis an affair neither good or
bad&mdash;or shameful or otherwise.&mdash;Why then did the delicacy
of Diogenes and Plato so recalcitrate against it? and wherefore,
when we go about to make and plant a man, do we put out the candle?
and for what reason is it, that all the parts thereof&mdash;the
congredients&mdash;the preparations&mdash;the instruments, and
whatever serves thereto, are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly
mind by no language, translation, or periphrasis whatever?</p>
<p>&mdash;The act of killing and destroying a man, continued my
father, raising his voice&mdash;and turning to my uncle
Toby&mdash;you see, is glorious&mdash;and the weapons by which we
do it are honourable&mdash;We march with them upon our
shoulders&mdash;We strut with them by our sides&mdash;We gild
them&mdash;We carve them&mdash;We in-lay them&mdash;We enrich
them&mdash;Nay, if it be but a scoundrel cannon, we cast an
ornament upon the breach of it.&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a
better epithet&mdash;and Yorick was rising up to batter the whole
hypothesis to pieces&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;When Obadiah broke into the middle of the room with a
complaint, which cried out for an immediate hearing.</p>
<p>The case was this:</p>
<p>My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as
impropriator of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a Bull for
the service of the Parish, and Obadiah had led his cow upon a
pop-visit to him one day or other the preceding summer&mdash;I say,
one day or other&mdash;because as chance would have it, it was the
day on which he was married to my father's house-maid&mdash;so one
was a reckoning to the other. Therefore when Obadiah's wife was
brought to bed&mdash;Obadiah thanked God&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;Now, said Obadiah, I shall have a calf: so Obadiah went
daily to visit his cow.</p>
<p>She'll calve on Monday&mdash;on Tuesday&mdash;on Wednesday at
the farthest&mdash;</p>
<p>The cow did not calve&mdash;no&mdash;she'll not calve till next
week&mdash;the cow put it off terribly&mdash;till at the end of the
sixth week Obadiah's suspicions (like a good man's) fell upon the
Bull.</p>
<p>Now the parish being very large, my father's Bull, to speak the
truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had, however,
got himself, somehow or other, thrust into employment&mdash;and as
he went through the business with a grave face, my father had a
high opinion of him.</p>
<p>&mdash;Most of the townsmen, an' please your worship, quoth
Obadiah, believe that 'tis all the Bull's fault&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;But may not a cow be barren? replied my father, turning
to Doctor Slop.</p>
<p>It never happens: said Dr. Slop, but the man's wife may have
come before her time naturally enough&mdash;Prithee has the child
hair upon his head?&mdash;added Dr. Slop&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;It is as hairy as I am; said Obadiah.&mdash;Obadiah had
not been shaved for three weeks&mdash;Wheu...u...u...cried my
father; beginning the sentence with an exclamatory
whistle&mdash;and so, brother Toby, this poor Bull of mine, who is
as good a Bull as ever p..ss'd, and might have done for Europa
herself in purer times&mdash;had he but two legs less, might have
been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his character&mdash;which
to a Town Bull, brother Toby, is the very same thing as his
life&mdash;</p>
<p>L..d! said my mother, what is all this story about?&mdash;</p>
<p>A Cock and a Bull, said Yorick&mdash;And one of the best of its
kind, I ever heard.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
